## Learning Path

This pack takes you through the story of modern systems programming, starting with the people who shaped how we build and manage software today.

### Start Here

Begin with **Linus Torvalds**, who created both the Linux kernel and Git. Understanding his contributions gives you context for why open source development works the way it does today.

### The Foundations

The **Linux Kernel** is the heart of countless systems - from Android phones to cloud servers to supercomputers. Understanding its history helps you appreciate the collaborative nature of open source.

### Modern Tools

**Git** revolutionized how developers work together. What started as a tool for Linux kernel development became the backbone of modern software collaboration.
