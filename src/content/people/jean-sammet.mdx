Jean Sammet (1928–2017) was an American computer scientist who created FORMAC and contributed to COBOL. Her history of programming languages documented the field's early development.

## COBOL Development

Sammet was a key member of the CODASYL committee that designed COBOL. Her work on the language helped create one of the most enduring programming languages, still processing business transactions worldwide.

## Creating FORMAC

At IBM, Sammet led development of FORMAC (1962-1964), the first widely used computer algebra system. FORMAC demonstrated that computers could manipulate mathematical symbols, not just crunch numbers.

## Programming Language History

Sammet wrote "Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals" (1969), the definitive early survey of programming languages. She documented over 120 languages, preserving knowledge that might otherwise have been lost.

## ACM Leadership

Sammet was active in the Association for Computing Machinery:

- First female president of ACM (1974-1976)
- Long service to SIGPLAN (programming languages group)
- Advocated for professional standards

## Legacy

Sammet bridged early computing and modern language design. Her historical work documented the field's origins, while FORMAC pioneered symbolic computation that continues in tools like Mathematica.
