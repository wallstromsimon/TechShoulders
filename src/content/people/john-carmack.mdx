John Carmack (born 1970) is an American programmer who pioneered 3D graphics technology in video games. His work at id Software on engines for Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake established techniques used throughout the games industry.

## Self-Taught Programmer

Carmack learned programming as a teenager, becoming proficient enough to start a small software company before founding id Software. His ability to optimize code and implement cutting-edge graphics on limited hardware became legendary.

## Technical Innovations

Carmack developed fundamental 3D graphics techniques:

- **Adaptive tile refresh**: Smooth scrolling on PC (Commander Keen)
- **Binary space partitioning**: Efficient rendering (Doom)
- **Texture mapping and lighting**: Realistic surfaces
- **Client-server networking**: Internet multiplayer (Quake)
- **Shadow volumes**: Dynamic shadows (Doom 3)

## Open Source Commitment

Carmack championed releasing source code:

- Released Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake engines under GPL
- Enabled learning and derivative works
- Advocated for openness in technology

## Rocket Science and VR

After id Software, Carmack became CTO of Oculus VR, working on virtual reality technology. He's also worked on rocket development with Armadillo Aerospace, applying his optimization mindset to spaceflight.

## Philosophy

Carmack is known for intense technical focus and learning in public. His .plan files and later tweets share detailed technical thinking, educating programmers worldwide.
