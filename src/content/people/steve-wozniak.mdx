Steve Wozniak (born 1950) is an American electronics engineer who co-founded Apple Computer and single-handedly designed the Apple I and Apple II. His engineering genius made personal computing accessible to ordinary people.

## Homebrew Computer Club

Wozniak was a member of the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley group of electronics hobbyists. Inspired by early microprocessors, he designed a computer he could afford—using minimal chips through clever engineering.

## The Apple I

In 1976, Wozniak showed his computer design to Steve Jobs, who proposed selling it. Working from Jobs's garage, they built and sold Apple I computers to hobbyists. Wozniak did all the engineering; Jobs handled business.

## The Apple II

The Apple II (1977) showcased Wozniak's engineering brilliance:

- First personal computer with color graphics
- Efficient design using minimal components
- Disk drive controller using fraction of typical chips
- Built-in BASIC interpreter

## Engineering Philosophy

Wozniak valued elegant engineering—solving problems with minimal hardware. His designs were noted for doing more with less, reflecting both engineering skill and limited budgets.

## Later Life

After a plane crash in 1981, Wozniak stepped back from Apple. He has since taught, done philanthropy, and remained a beloved figure in technology. Unlike Jobs, Wozniak was always more engineer than businessman—happiest when building things.
