Robert Griesemer is a Swiss computer scientist who co-created Go and contributed to V8. His background in compiler and VM technology influenced Go's design as a fast-compiling, efficient language.

## Background

Griesemer worked on several significant projects:

- **Ceres/Oberon**: Work under Niklaus Wirth
- **HotSpot JVM**: Java's high-performance VM at Sun
- **V8**: Google's JavaScript engine
- **Go**: Google's systems language

## Co-creating Go

At Google, Griesemer joined Rob Pike and Ken Thompson in designing Go. Frustrated by C++ compilation times and complexity, they created a simple, fast-compiling language for systems programming.

## Contributions to Go

Griesemer focused on:

- Language specification and semantics
- Type system design
- Compiler implementation
- Fast compilation (a key Go feature)

## V8 Contributions

Before Go, Griesemer worked on V8, contributing to the JavaScript engine that proved dynamic languages could be fast.

## Philosophy

Griesemer shares Go's design philosophy: simplicity, clarity, and practical engineering over theoretical elegance. His diverse experience in VM and language implementation informed Go's pragmatic approach.
