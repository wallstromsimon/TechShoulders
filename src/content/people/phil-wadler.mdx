Philip Wadler is a British computer scientist who made foundational contributions to programming language theory and design. His work on Haskell, monads, and type systems influenced languages from Java to Rust.

## Haskell Committee

Wadler was a key member of the committee that designed Haskell. He contributed to the type system design and helped establish Haskell's approach to pure functional programming.

## Monads Paper

Wadler's 1992 paper "The essence of functional programming" introduced monads as a way to structure programs with side effects. This insight transformed functional programming, providing a principled way to handle I/O, state, and other effects.

## Java Generics

Wadler contributed to the design of Java generics through his work on Generic Java (GJ). His theoretical understanding of type systems helped bring parameterized types to mainstream programming.

## Propositions as Types

Wadler has been a passionate advocate for the Curry-Howard correspondence—the deep connection between logic and computation. His talk "Propositions as Types" explains how every logical proof corresponds to a program.

## Teaching and Advocacy

As a professor at the University of Edinburgh, Wadler has trained generations of programming language researchers. He's known for entertaining conference presentations that make complex topics accessible.
