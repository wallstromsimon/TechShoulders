Fabrice Bellard (born 1972) is a French computer programmer renowned for creating multiple fundamental software projects. His work on QEMU, FFmpeg, and other tools has influenced virtually every area of computing.

## Prolific Output

Bellard's projects span diverse domains:

- **FFmpeg (2000)**: Multimedia processing, used everywhere
- **QEMU (2003)**: Emulation/virtualization, powers cloud computing
- **TinyCC (TCC)**: Tiny C compiler, compiles itself in seconds
- **QuickJS**: Compact JavaScript engine
- **BPG**: Better image format than JPEG

## Technical Mastery

Bellard's work demonstrates extraordinary breadth:

- Low-level systems programming (QEMU, TCC)
- Signal processing (FFmpeg codecs)
- Mathematical computation (pi calculation records)
- Language implementation (QuickJS)

## Mathematical Achievements

Beyond software, Bellard computed pi to record precision using a desktop computer, demonstrating algorithmic optimization skills.

## Philosophy

Bellard tends to work alone on challenging problems, producing remarkably compact and efficient code. His projects often start from first principles rather than extending existing work, leading to innovative solutions.

## Impact

Bellard's software underlies much of modern computing:

- Cloud infrastructure runs on QEMU/KVM
- Video applications use FFmpeg
- His work enables billions of daily operations
