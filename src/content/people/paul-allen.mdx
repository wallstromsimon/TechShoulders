Paul Allen (1953–2018) was an American computer programmer and entrepreneur who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates. His technical skills and vision helped launch the personal computer software revolution.

## Microsoft Origins

In 1975, Allen saw the Altair 8800 on the cover of Popular Electronics and convinced Gates they should write a BASIC interpreter for it. Allen wrote the bootstrap loader while Gates and Monte Davidoff wrote the interpreter—all before having access to actual hardware.

## Technical Contributions

Allen's early work included:

- Bootstrap loader for Altair BASIC
- Early Microsoft development tools
- MS-DOS acquisition strategy (seeing potential in Tim Paterson's QDOS)
- Software architecture decisions

## Microsoft Co-Founder

Allen and Gates built Microsoft from a two-person company into the dominant software company of the PC era. Allen served as Executive Vice President until 1983, when he left due to Hodgkin's disease.

## Post-Microsoft

After leaving Microsoft, Allen:

- Invested in technology companies (DreamWorks, Ticketmaster)
- Owned sports teams (Seattle Seahawks, Portland Trail Blazers)
- Founded the Allen Institute for Brain Science
- Supported space exploration (SpaceShipOne)

## Philanthropy

Through the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, he donated over $2 billion to:

- Scientific research
- Arts and culture
- Conservation
- Community development

## Legacy

Allen exemplified the technical co-founder who combined programming ability with strategic vision. His partnership with Gates created the template for technology startup success.
