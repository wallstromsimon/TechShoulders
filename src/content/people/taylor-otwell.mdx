Taylor Otwell is an American software developer who created Laravel. His focus on developer experience and elegant code transformed PHP development and built a successful business around open source.

## Creating Laravel

Otwell released Laravel in 2011 after becoming frustrated with existing PHP frameworks. He wanted to bring Ruby on Rails-style conventions and modern PHP practices to framework development.

## Design Philosophy

Otwell emphasizes:

- Elegant, expressive syntax
- Comprehensive features out of the box
- Beautiful documentation
- Developer happiness and productivity

## Building a Business

Unlike many open-source maintainers, Otwell built a sustainable business:

- **Laravel Forge**: Server provisioning and deployment
- **Laravel Vapor**: Serverless platform
- **Laravel Nova**: Administration panel
- **Laravel Spark**: SaaS starter kit

## Impact on PHP

Laravel changed PHP's reputation:

- Showed PHP code could be elegant
- Attracted developers who might have left for other languages
- Influenced PHP language evolution
- Created an ecosystem of modern PHP tools

Otwell demonstrates that open-source work can be both impactful and financially sustainable.
