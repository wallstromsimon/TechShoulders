Chuck Moore (born 1938) is an American computer engineer who created Forth. His radical minimalism—in language design and life—produced remarkably efficient software and hardware.

## Creating Forth

Moore developed Forth in the late 1960s for controlling radio telescopes. He needed a language that was interactive, efficient, and fit in limited memory. Forth met all requirements in a tiny footprint.

## Philosophy

Moore's approach is radically minimalist:

- Simple solutions over complex ones
- Eliminate everything unnecessary
- Direct hardware control
- Question every assumption

## colorForth and Chips

Moore continued innovating:

- **colorForth**: Uses color instead of syntax
- **Custom chips**: Designed processors optimized for Forth
- **GreenArrays**: Multi-core Forth processors

## Impact

Forth influenced computing in several ways:

- PostScript interpreter is stack-based like Forth
- Open Firmware boot loader uses Forth
- Embedded systems still use Forth
- Concatenative languages descend from Forth

## Contrarian Path

Moore represents an alternative path in computing—proving that extreme simplicity can solve problems that others address with complexity. His willingness to question orthodoxy produced unique solutions.
