Jim Gray (1944–2007) was an American computer scientist who pioneered transaction processing and database systems. His work on ensuring data integrity and reliability earned him the Turing Award and influences every database system today.

## Transaction Processing

Gray formalized the ACID properties for database transactions:

- **Atomicity**: Transactions complete entirely or not at all
- **Consistency**: Transactions maintain valid database states
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- **Durability**: Committed transactions persist despite failures

## Write-Ahead Logging

Gray developed write-ahead logging (WAL), a technique for ensuring durability while maintaining performance. The idea—write intent to a log before modifying data—became standard in all database systems.

## Distributed Databases

Gray contributed fundamental concepts for distributed systems:

- Two-phase commit protocol
- Distributed locking
- Replication strategies

## Career

Gray worked at IBM Research, Tandem Computers, DEC, and Microsoft Research. At each institution, he advanced the state of database and transaction technology.

## Disappearance

Gray disappeared while sailing near San Francisco in 2007. A massive search, including crowdsourced satellite image analysis, was unsuccessful. His contributions to computing remain fundamental to how we handle data.
