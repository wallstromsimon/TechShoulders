Thomas E. Kurtz (born 1928) is an American computer scientist who co-created BASIC with John Kemeny. His commitment to making computing accessible shaped computer education for generations.

## Creating BASIC

At Dartmouth, Kurtz and Kemeny created BASIC to make programming accessible to all students. Kurtz led much of the implementation work, developing the language and its environment.

## Dartmouth Time Sharing System

Kurtz helped develop DTSS, which allowed many students to use computers interactively. The combination of BASIC and time-sharing made computing accessible without waiting for batch processing.

## Philosophy

Kurtz believed computing should be:

- Accessible to non-specialists
- Interactive and immediate
- Educational, not just vocational
- Available to all students, not just scientists

## True BASIC

In 1983, Kurtz and Kemeny created True BASIC, a modern BASIC implementation maintaining educational principles. They wanted to preserve BASIC's accessibility while adding structured programming features.

## Legacy

Kurtz continues to advocate for computing education. His work with Kemeny showed that programming languages could be designed for learners, not just experts.
