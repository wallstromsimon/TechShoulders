Igor Sysoev is a Russian software engineer who created Nginx. His work on high-performance web serving changed how the internet handles traffic and challenged decades-old assumptions about web server architecture.

## Background

Sysoev worked as a system administrator at Rambler, a large Russian internet company. Frustrated by Apache's inability to handle Rambler's growing traffic, he began developing Nginx in 2002.

## Solving C10K

The "C10K problem"—handling 10,000 concurrent connections—was unsolved by traditional web servers. Apache created a process or thread per connection, consuming resources that limited scalability. Sysoev designed Nginx to use event-driven, non-blocking I/O.

## Open Source Release

Nginx was released publicly in 2004 under a BSD-like license. Its performance advantages led to rapid adoption, particularly for high-traffic sites and as a reverse proxy.

## Nginx Inc.

In 2011, Sysoev co-founded Nginx Inc. to provide commercial support and enterprise features. The company was acquired by F5 Networks in 2019 for $670 million.

## Impact

Nginx demonstrated that questioning fundamental architectural decisions could yield dramatic improvements. Its event-driven model influenced web server design and became standard for modern web infrastructure.
