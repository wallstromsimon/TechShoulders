Graydon Hoare is a Canadian programmer who created Rust. His work on memory safety without garbage collection addresses problems that have plagued systems programming for decades.

## Creating Rust

Hoare started Rust as a personal project in 2006, frustrated by crashes in software he depended on. Mozilla began sponsoring development in 2009, and Hoare led the project until 2013.

## Key Insight

Hoare's key insight was that ownership rules could be checked at compile time:

- Every value has exactly one owner
- Borrowing must follow strict rules
- The compiler ensures memory safety

This approach provides C-like performance with memory safety guarantees.

## Design Influences

Rust drew from diverse sources:

- ML family: Pattern matching, algebraic types
- C++: Zero-cost abstractions, RAII
- Cyclone: Region-based memory management
- Haskell: Type classes (traits)

## Stepping Back

Hoare stepped away from Rust leadership in 2013, letting the community drive development. This transition proved successful—Rust continued growing and improving under community governance.

## Impact

Rust has gained remarkable adoption for a language its age, with Linux, Microsoft, AWS, and others adopting it for safety-critical code. Hoare's insight that ownership could be enforced statically may prove historically significant.
