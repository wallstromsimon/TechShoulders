Roy Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist who co-founded Apache HTTP Server and defined the REST architectural style. His work on web architecture underlies how modern web services communicate.

## Apache HTTP Server

Fielding was a founding member of the Apache Group in 1995. The team took over maintenance of the NCSA HTTPd web server and built it into the dominant web server of its era.

## HTTP/1.1

As a principal author of the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616), Fielding helped define the protocol that enabled the web to scale. His understanding of HTTP's architectural principles informed his later work.

## Defining REST

Fielding's 2000 doctoral dissertation "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures" defined REST. He analyzed why the web succeeded architecturally and extracted principles that could guide web service design.

## REST's Influence

REST became the dominant API design paradigm:

- "RESTful APIs" replaced SOAP in most contexts
- Web services adopted resource-oriented design
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) as verbs

## Correcting REST Misconceptions

Fielding has often clarified what REST actually means, noting that many "REST APIs" violate core constraints. True REST requires hypermedia controls (HATEOAS), which most APIs lack.
