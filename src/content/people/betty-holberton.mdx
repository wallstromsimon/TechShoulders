Betty Holberton (1917–2001) was one of the six original programmers of ENIAC and a pioneer in software development. Her contributions to early programming languages and practices influenced computing for decades.

## ENIAC Programming

Holberton was one of six women selected to program ENIAC. With no programming manuals or precedents, they invented programming techniques from scratch. Holberton's logical approach and attention to detail made her essential to the team.

## Software Innovations

Holberton created foundational software concepts:

- **Sort-merge generator**: First software application
- **Breakpoints**: Debugging technique still used today
- **Numeric keypad layout**: 0 at bottom, influenced by her design

## Language Development

Holberton contributed to major early languages:

- **COBOL**: Member of design committee
- **FORTRAN**: Contributed to development
- **C-10**: Wrote instruction codes

## Recognition

Long overlooked, Holberton eventually received recognition:

- Ada Lovelace Award (1997)
- Inducted into Women in Technology International Hall of Fame

Her story represents many women whose contributions to early computing were only recognized decades later.
