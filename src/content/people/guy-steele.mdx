Guy L. Steele Jr. (born 1954) is an American computer scientist who has shaped multiple programming languages. From co-creating Scheme to standardizing Common Lisp and contributing to Java, his influence spans decades of language design.

## Creating Scheme

As a graduate student at MIT, Steele collaborated with Gerald Jay Sussman to create Scheme. Their exploration of the actor model led to insights about closures and lexical scoping that produced an elegantly minimal Lisp dialect.

## Lambda Papers

Steele and Sussman wrote a series of influential papers explaining Scheme, known as the "Lambda Papers." These papers, including "Lambda: The Ultimate Imperative," demonstrated how lambda expressions could express all programming constructs.

## Common Lisp

Steele edited "Common Lisp: The Language," the specification that unified various Lisp dialects. This standardization work demonstrated his ability to build consensus among divergent communities.

## Java and ECMAScript

Steele contributed to the Java Language Specification and was involved in ECMAScript standardization. His experience spanning multiple language paradigms brought depth to these efforts.

## "Growing a Language"

Steele's famous 1998 talk "Growing a Language" demonstrated language evolution using only one-syllable words unless he defined longer ones. The presentation brilliantly illustrated how languages must be designed to grow.
