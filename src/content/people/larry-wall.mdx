Larry Wall (born 1954) is an American programmer and author, best known as the creator of Perl. His background as a linguist influenced Perl's unique design, which borrows concepts from natural language.

## Background

Wall studied linguistics and considered becoming a missionary before turning to programming. His linguistic training shaped his view of programming languages as human communication tools, not just technical notation.

## Creating Perl

Wall created Perl in 1987 while working as a systems administrator. He needed to generate reports from text files across multiple systems. Frustrated with the limitations of existing tools, he created Perl to combine their best features.

## Linguistic Influence

Wall applied linguistic principles to language design:

- **Context sensitivity**: Like natural languages, Perl interprets based on context
- **Multiple expressions**: Many ways to say the same thing, like human languages
- **Huffman coding**: Common operations have shorter syntax
- **Borrowing**: Taking good ideas from other languages freely

## The Three Virtues

Wall famously defined the three virtues of a great programmer:

1. **Laziness**: Drives automation and reusable code
2. **Impatience**: Drives efficient, fast programs
3. **Hubris**: Drives writing code others can't criticize

## Later Work

Wall spent years developing Perl 6 (now called Raku), a complete redesign of the language. Though Raku and Perl 5 diverged into separate languages, both continue development.
