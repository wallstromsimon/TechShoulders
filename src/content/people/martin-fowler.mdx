Martin Fowler (born 1963) is a British-American software developer and author known for his work on software design patterns, refactoring, and agile development. His books and articles have shaped how developers think about software architecture.

## Influential Books

Fowler authored several foundational texts:

- **Refactoring** (1999): Catalog of code improvement techniques
- **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture** (2002): Patterns for business systems
- **UML Distilled** (1997): Concise guide to modeling notation
- **Domain-Specific Languages** (2010): Building internal and external DSLs

## Refactoring

His "Refactoring" book transformed code improvement from ad-hoc tinkering into a systematic discipline. The techniques became features in major IDEs and fundamentals of professional development practice.

## Agile Manifesto

Fowler was one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto in 2001. His writings have continued to interpret and promote agile values, particularly around technical practices and continuous delivery.

## ThoughtWorks

As Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks, Fowler has influenced industry practices in:

- Continuous integration and delivery
- Microservices architecture
- Evolutionary database design
- Technology radar and industry trends

## Legacy

Through his website martinfowler.com, books, and conference talks, Fowler has become one of the most influential voices in software development methodology. His ability to articulate patterns and practices has shaped how teams approach software design.
