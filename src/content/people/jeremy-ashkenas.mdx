Jeremy Ashkenas is an American programmer known for creating CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, and Underscore.js. His work in the early 2010s shaped JavaScript development and influenced the language's evolution.

## DocumentCloud

Ashkenas created his major projects while at DocumentCloud, a tool for journalists to analyze documents. Building complex document analysis UIs drove the need for both a better JavaScript syntax and structured application architecture.

## Creating CoffeeScript

CoffeeScript (2009) addressed JavaScript's syntax pain points with Ruby and Python-inspired improvements. Its popularity demonstrated developer demand for features that JavaScript later adopted in ES6.

## Creating Backbone.js

Backbone (2010) provided minimal structure for JavaScript applications: models, views, collections, and routers. It was one of the first client-side MVC frameworks and influenced all frameworks that followed.

## Creating Underscore.js

Underscore.js provided utility functions for working with collections, objects, and functions. It became a foundation for JavaScript development until lodash and native methods supplanted it.

## Legacy

Ashkenas's projects shared a philosophy: provide what JavaScript lacked with minimal overhead. All three projects eventually became less necessary as JavaScript evolved—perhaps the highest compliment to their influence.
