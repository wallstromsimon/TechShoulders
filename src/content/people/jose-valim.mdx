José Valim (born 1986) is a Brazilian software developer who created Elixir. His background in Ruby on Rails and focus on developer experience brought Erlang's powerful runtime to a broader audience.

## Ruby Background

Valim was a member of the Ruby on Rails core team and created several widely-used Ruby gems including Devise (authentication). His experience with Rails shaped his understanding of developer experience and productivity.

## Creating Elixir

While exploring concurrency solutions, Valim discovered Erlang's powerful runtime but found its syntax and tooling challenging. He created Elixir to provide modern developer ergonomics while leveraging the battle-tested BEAM virtual machine.

## Design Philosophy

Elixir reflects Valim's priorities:

- **Developer productivity**: Clear syntax and good error messages
- **Extensibility**: Macros allow extending the language
- **Compatibility**: Full interop with Erlang libraries
- **Tooling**: First-class build tools, testing, and documentation

## Phoenix and LiveView

Valim has been instrumental in Phoenix framework development and created LiveView—a paradigm for building real-time web applications that render on the server, avoiding JavaScript complexity while maintaining interactivity.

## Community Building

Valim actively grows the Elixir community through conference talks, documentation, and Elixir Forum engagement. His accessible communication style helps make functional programming less intimidating.
