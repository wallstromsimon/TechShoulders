Peter Naur (1928–2016) was a Danish computer scientist who edited the ALGOL 60 report and co-developed Backus-Naur Form. His work on language specification and software engineering earned him the Turing Award.

## ALGOL 60

Naur edited the ALGOL 60 report, transforming a committee design into a clear, precise specification. His editorial work established a standard for how programming languages are described.

## Backus-Naur Form

BNF (originally Backus Normal Form, renamed to honor Naur's contributions) provides a notation for describing programming language syntax. Nearly every language since has been specified using BNF or derivatives.

## Software Engineering

Naur contributed to software engineering as a discipline:

- Advocated for clear program design
- Criticized overly formal methods
- Emphasized programming as human activity
- Wrote influential essays on software development

## "Programming as Theory Building"

Naur's essay argued that programming is fundamentally about building a theory of how a program works in programmers' minds, not just writing code. This humanistic view influenced software engineering thinking.

## Recognition

Naur received the Turing Award in 2005 for his contributions to programming language design and definition.
