Ray Kurzweil (born 1948) is an American inventor and futurist who pioneered optical character recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech recognition. His practical AI applications transformed accessibility technology.

## Early Inventions

Kurzweil showed early talent:

- At 15, wrote a computer program that composed music
- At 17, appeared on TV demonstrating the program
- Founded his first company while at MIT

## OCR Breakthrough

In 1974, Kurzweil developed the first omni-font OCR—software that could recognize text printed in any normal font. Previous systems required specific fonts or extensive training.

## Reading Machine for the Blind

Combining OCR with text-to-speech, Kurzweil created the Kurzweil Reading Machine (1976), the first device to read printed text aloud. This transformed access to information for blind users. Stevie Wonder purchased the first production unit.

## Speech and Music Technology

Kurzweil continued innovating:

- **Kurzweil 250** (1984): First synthesizer to realistically reproduce grand piano and other instruments
- **Speech recognition**: Developed large-vocabulary speech recognition systems

## Later Career

Kurzweil joined Google in 2012 to work on machine learning and natural language processing. He's known for predictions about technological advancement and "the singularity."

## Legacy

Kurzweil demonstrated that AI could solve practical problems and improve lives. His work on accessibility technology gave blind users access to printed materials, fundamentally changing their independence and opportunities.
