Walter Bright is an American programmer known for creating the D programming language and the first native C++ compiler for DOS. His deep compiler expertise has influenced systems programming languages for decades.

## Compiler Pioneer

In the 1980s, Bright created Zortech C++, the first C++ compiler to generate native code on DOS. Before this, C++ required expensive workstations. Zortech made C++ accessible to PC developers.

## Creating D

Frustrated with C++'s complexity and historical baggage, Bright began designing D in 1999. His goal was to create a modern systems programming language that retained C's efficiency while fixing its problems.

## Design Philosophy

Bright's approach to D reflects his practical experience:

- Powerful metaprogramming through compile-time function execution
- Optional garbage collection for different use cases
- C interoperability to leverage existing code
- Built-in testing and documentation

## Compiler Technology

Bright continues developing DMD, D's reference compiler. His work demonstrates how a single developer can create a complete, production-quality compiler—a feat increasingly rare in modern language development.

## Industry Influence

Though D hasn't achieved widespread adoption, its technical innovations—particularly in metaprogramming and compile-time execution—have influenced language designers. Rust, Nim, and Zig all acknowledge D's influence.
