Chris Granger (born 1985) is an American programmer and designer who created Light Table and Eve. His work explores how to make programming more immediate, visual, and accessible.

## Microsoft and Visual Studio

Before Light Table, Granger worked at Microsoft on Visual Studio, giving him insight into how professional IDEs work—and what they could do better.

## Light Table

In 2012, Granger launched Light Table on Kickstarter, raising over $316,000. The IDE demonstrated:

- Inline evaluation (see results next to code)
- Live programming (changes appear instantly)
- Connected editing (modify running programs)
- Novel documentation integration

## Eve Programming Language

After Light Table, Granger developed Eve, an experimental programming language and environment aimed at making programming accessible to non-programmers. Eve explored:

- Visual programming concepts
- Literate programming
- Database-driven computation
- Natural language-like syntax

## Influence

Granger's ideas influenced:

- VS Code development (he consulted for Microsoft)
- Modern IDE features
- Live programming research
- Developer experience design

## Philosophy

Granger advocates for:

- Reducing the gap between writing code and seeing results
- Making programming visual and immediate
- Questioning assumptions about how we program
- Designing for understanding, not just writing

## Legacy

Granger demonstrated that the programming environment itself could be radically reimagined. His work inspired developers and researchers to explore new ways of interacting with code.
