Ivan Sutherland (born 1938) is an American computer scientist known as the "father of computer graphics." His Sketchpad program pioneered interactive graphics, and his later work established virtual reality as a field.

## Sketchpad

For his 1963 PhD thesis at MIT, Sutherland created Sketchpad on the TX-2 computer. Users could draw shapes on a screen using a light pen, constrain their relationships, and manipulate them interactively. The thesis is considered one of the most influential in computer science history.

## Virtual Reality Pioneer

In 1968, Sutherland created the "Sword of Damocles"—the first head-mounted display system. Though primitive by modern standards, it established concepts fundamental to VR: head tracking, stereoscopic display, and immersive environments.

## Academic Influence

Sutherland taught at Harvard, Utah, and later Caltech. His students went on to found influential companies (Adobe, Silicon Graphics, Pixar) and advance computer graphics.

## Recognition

Sutherland received the Turing Award in 1988 for Sketchpad and the Kyoto Prize in 2012. His work established interactive computer graphics as a field and anticipated object-oriented programming, GUI design, and virtual reality.
