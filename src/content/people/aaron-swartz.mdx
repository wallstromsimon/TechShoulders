Aaron Swartz (1986–2013) was an American programmer, writer, and activist who contributed to foundational web technologies and championed open access to information. His work on RSS, Reddit, and web.py demonstrated remarkable technical ability, while his activism shaped debates about information freedom.

## Early Technical Work

Swartz showed extraordinary talent early:

- Co-authored RSS 1.0 specification at age 14
- Worked on Creative Commons technical infrastructure
- Co-founded Reddit (later acquired by Condé Nast)

## Open Access Advocacy

Swartz became passionate about making information freely accessible:

- Downloaded millions of JSTOR academic articles
- Argued for open access to taxpayer-funded research
- Helped defeat SOPA/PIPA legislation

## Legal Troubles

Federal prosecutors charged Swartz with computer fraud for downloading JSTOR articles, seeking up to 35 years imprisonment. The aggressive prosecution drew widespread criticism.

- Open access policies at universities
- Debate about prosecutorial overreach
- Information freedom movement

His technical contributions and activism continue to inspire those working for an open internet.
