Rich Hickey is an American programmer best known as the creator of Clojure. His emphasis on simplicity, immutability, and functional programming has influenced programmers far beyond the Clojure community.

## Creating Clojure

Hickey spent about two years developing Clojure before its 2007 release, working without income to pursue his vision. He wanted a practical Lisp that could leverage the JVM while embracing functional programming and immutability.

## Philosophy

Hickey's talks articulate a distinctive philosophy:

- **"Simple Made Easy"**: Simplicity (few concepts) differs from easiness (familiarity)
- **"The Value of Values"**: Immutable values are safer than mutable objects
- **"Hammock-Driven Development"**: Deep thinking matters more than typing

## Datomic

Hickey created Datomic, a database that applies Clojure's principles to data storage:

- Immutable database—facts are added, never modified
- Time travel—query the database as of any point in time
- Datalog query language

## Influence Beyond Clojure

Hickey's ideas spread beyond his language:

- His talks are widely viewed and quoted
- Persistent data structures influenced other languages
- The simple/easy distinction became common vocabulary
- Functional programming gained mainstream credibility
