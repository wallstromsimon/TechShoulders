Yukihiro Matsumoto (born 1965), also known as "Matz," is a Japanese computer scientist and the creator of Ruby. His focus on programmer happiness and elegant code made Ruby unique among programming languages.

## Philosophy

Matsumoto's design philosophy centers on human factors:

> "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy."

He believes that programming should be enjoyable, and that languages should minimize surprise and maximize expressiveness.

## Creating Ruby

Matsumoto began developing Ruby in 1993, releasing it publicly in 1995. He drew inspiration from Perl's practicality, Smalltalk's purity, and Lisp's power, creating a language that blended these influences into something unique.

## Design Decisions

Key Ruby design choices reflect Matsumoto's priorities:

- Pure object-orientation where everything is an object
- Flexible syntax allowing multiple ways to express ideas
- Powerful metaprogramming for elegant DSLs
- Focus on readability and natural expression

## Community Leadership

Matsumoto remains Ruby's "benevolent dictator," guiding the language's evolution. Unlike some language creators who moved on, he continues active involvement in Ruby's development and community.

## Impact

Ruby's influence extends beyond its users. The language's emphasis on developer experience influenced other languages and frameworks, helping shift industry attention toward developer productivity and happiness.
