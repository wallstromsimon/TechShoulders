Ryan Dahl is an American software engineer who created Node.js and Deno. His work on event-driven JavaScript runtimes transformed server-side development and enabled full-stack JavaScript development.

## Creating Node.js

Dahl presented Node.js at JSConf EU in 2009. He was frustrated by how traditional web servers blocked on I/O operations, wasting resources while waiting. JavaScript's event-driven model offered an alternative.

## Node.js's Impact

Node.js changed web development:

- JavaScript became viable on servers
- Real-time applications became practical
- npm grew into the largest package ecosystem
- Build tools moved to JavaScript

## Leaving Node.js

Dahl stepped away from Node.js in 2012, though the project continued thriving under community and corporate stewardship. He worked on other projects before returning to JavaScript runtimes.

## "10 Things I Regret About Node.js"

In 2018, Dahl gave a famous talk listing Node.js design mistakes: security, package.json complexity, CommonJS modules, and more. He announced Deno as a fresh start.

## Creating Deno

Deno applies lessons learned from Node.js:

- Security permissions by default
- TypeScript as a first-class language
- URL-based imports
- Web-standard APIs

Dahl's willingness to publicly critique his own successful creation and start over demonstrates rare intellectual honesty in technology.
