James Gosling (born 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist best known as the creator of Java. His work on platform-independent computing and managed runtime environments transformed enterprise software development.

## Early Career

Gosling earned his PhD from Carnegie Mellon, where he wrote a version of Emacs for Unix. He joined Sun Microsystems in 1984 and worked on various projects including the NeWS windowing system.

## Creating Java

In 1991, Gosling led the team developing "Oak" (later renamed Java) for Sun's Green Project. The language was designed for embedded systems in consumer electronics, with portability and security as primary goals.

## Design Philosophy

Gosling's design decisions for Java reflected practical concerns:

- **C/C++ syntax**: Familiar to most programmers
- **No pointers**: Eliminate a major source of bugs
- **Garbage collection**: Automatic memory management
- **Strong typing**: Catch errors early
- **Bytecode**: Compile once, run anywhere

## Java's Impact

Java's success exceeded expectations:

- Became the dominant enterprise language
- Powered server-side web development for decades
- Became Android's primary language
- Spawned an ecosystem of JVM languages

## Later Work

After Oracle acquired Sun, Gosling briefly worked at Google and then Amazon Web Services. He continues to work on software development tools and has received numerous awards including the IEEE John von Neumann Medal.
