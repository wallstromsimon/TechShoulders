Cleve Moler (born 1939) is an American mathematician and computer scientist who created MATLAB and co-founded MathWorks. His work made numerical computing accessible to engineers and scientists without requiring expertise in programming languages like Fortran.

## Early Career

Moler was a professor at the University of Michigan and Stanford. He co-authored LINPACK and EISPACK, the standard Fortran libraries for linear algebra that became the foundation for MATLAB.

## Creating MATLAB

In the late 1970s, Moler created MATLAB as a teaching tool so students could use LINPACK and EISPACK without learning Fortran. The interactive, matrix-oriented syntax made numerical computation accessible.

## MathWorks

In 1984, Moler co-founded MathWorks with Jack Little to commercialize MATLAB. The company grew MATLAB into a comprehensive platform for:

- Numerical analysis
- Algorithm development
- Data visualization
- Simulation (Simulink)

## Technical Contributions

Beyond MATLAB, Moler contributed to:

- LINPACK (linear algebra)
- EISPACK (eigenvalue computation)
- Numerical analysis theory
- Education in computational mathematics

## Recognition

Moler received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award and the SIAM Prize for Distinguished Service to the Profession. He remains chairman of MathWorks.

## Legacy

MATLAB transformed how engineers and scientists work with numerical data. Its influence extends to NumPy, Julia, and other modern scientific computing tools that adopted its matrix-oriented approach.
