Ken Kennedy (1945–2007) was an American computer scientist who pioneered optimizing compilers and parallel programming languages. His work enabled scientists and engineers to harness supercomputer power without mastering low-level parallel programming.

## High Performance Fortran

Kennedy led the High Performance Fortran Forum, creating HPF as a standard for data-parallel programming. HPF aimed to let programmers write simple code while compilers handled the complexity of distributing computation across processors.

## Compiler Research

Kennedy's research at Rice University advanced:

- **Dependence analysis**: Understanding which computations can run in parallel
- **Loop transformations**: Optimizing loops for cache and parallelism
- **Interprocedural analysis**: Optimizing across function boundaries
- **Automatic parallelization**: Converting sequential code to parallel

## Rice University

Kennedy founded and built Rice's computer science department into a leading center for compiler and parallel computing research. Many influential compiler researchers trained under his guidance.

## Industry Impact

Kennedy's compiler techniques were adopted by:

- Intel, IBM, and other processor vendors
- High-performance computing centers
- Scientific computing applications
- Modern compiler frameworks

## Recognition

Kennedy received the ACM-IEEE Ken Kennedy Award (named after him posthumously), the ACM Software System Award, and numerous other honors for his contributions to high-performance computing.

## Legacy

Kennedy's vision was that parallel programming should be accessible to domain scientists, not just parallel computing experts. His research continues to influence how we compile code for modern multi-core and distributed systems.
