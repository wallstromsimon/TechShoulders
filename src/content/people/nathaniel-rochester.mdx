Nathaniel Rochester (1919–2001) was an American computer scientist who created the first assembler for the IBM 701 and contributed to early artificial intelligence research. His work established the concept of using computers to help write programs.

## The First Assembler

In 1953, Rochester created the assembler for the IBM 701, the first tool to translate symbolic assembly language into machine code. Before this, programmers wrote raw machine code—tedious and error-prone work.

## IBM Career

Rochester joined IBM in 1948 and contributed to:

- IBM 701 architecture and design
- The first assembler
- Programming methodology
- Computer organization theory

## AI Pioneer

Rochester was one of the four organizers of the 1956 Dartmouth Conference that founded artificial intelligence as a field. He wrote early pattern recognition programs and explored machine learning concepts.

## Dartmouth Conference

With John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Claude Shannon, Rochester organized the seminal summer workshop that coined the term "artificial intelligence" and established AI as a research discipline.

## Legacy

Rochester's assembler established a fundamental principle: computers should help programmers write programs. This idea evolved into compilers, IDEs, and all modern development tools. Every programmer today benefits from the concept he pioneered.
