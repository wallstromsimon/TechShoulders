James Clark (born 1964) is a British software developer who played a crucial role in developing XML and creating essential tools for processing markup languages. His work on parsers and transformation engines enabled the practical adoption of SGML and XML.

## XML Development

Clark was the technical lead for the XML specification at W3C. He helped simplify SGML into a format practical for web use while maintaining its power for structured data.

## Essential Tools

Clark created foundational software:

- **expat**: Fast, non-validating XML parser used everywhere (Python, Apache, Mozilla)
- **groff**: GNU troff text formatter
- **jade**: DSSSL engine for SGML/XML transformation
- **nxml-mode**: Emacs mode for XML editing

## SGML Contributions

Before XML, Clark was instrumental in making SGML practical:

- Created SP, the standard SGML parser
- Developed transformation tools
- Helped standardize DSSSL (Document Style Semantics and Specification Language)

## RELAX NG

Clark co-created RELAX NG, a schema language for XML that's simpler and more expressive than XML Schema. It became an ISO standard and remains popular for XML validation.

## Legacy

Clark's tools and specifications form the foundation of XML processing. His emphasis on simplicity, correctness, and practical implementation influenced how structured data is processed across the industry.
