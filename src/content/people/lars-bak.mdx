Lars Bak is a Danish computer programmer known for creating high-performance virtual machines. His work on Self, HotSpot (Java), V8 (JavaScript), and Dart has influenced how dynamic languages achieve performance.

## Virtual Machine Expert

Bak's career focused on making dynamic languages fast:

- **Self VM**: Pioneered adaptive optimization
- **HotSpot**: Java's high-performance VM (at Sun)
- **V8**: JavaScript at near-native speeds
- **Dart VM**: Continued optimization work

## Creating V8

At Google, Bak led the V8 JavaScript engine project. V8's just-in-time compilation made JavaScript fast enough for complex web applications, enabling the modern web.

## Creating Dart

Bak co-created Dart with Kasper Lund at Google. Though Dart didn't replace JavaScript in browsers as originally hoped, it found success as Flutter's language for cross-platform development.

## Technical Approach

Bak's VMs share common techniques:

- Adaptive optimization based on runtime behavior
- Inline caching for dynamic dispatch
- Generational garbage collection
- Compilation to native code

## Impact

Bak's work transformed what dynamic languages can achieve. The techniques he helped develop are now standard in all modern JavaScript engines and beyond.
