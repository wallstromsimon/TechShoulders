Bjarne Stroustrup (born 1950) is a Danish computer scientist best known as the creator of C++. His work on combining object-oriented programming with systems programming efficiency has influenced software development for four decades.

## Background

Stroustrup studied at Aarhus University in Denmark and earned his PhD from Cambridge. His doctoral work on distributed systems using Simula gave him appreciation for object-oriented programming, while also revealing Simula's performance limitations.

## Creating C++

At Bell Labs in 1979, Stroustrup began developing "C with Classes" to combine Simula's organizational power with C's efficiency. He needed a language for his distributed systems research that could handle both high-level design and low-level performance requirements.

## Design Philosophy

Stroustrup's design principles for C++ include:

- **Zero-overhead abstraction**: Features shouldn't cost if you don't use them
- **Multi-paradigm**: Support procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming
- **Compatibility**: Work with existing C code and tools
- **Trust the programmer**: Don't prevent experts from doing what they need

## "The Design and Evolution of C++"

Stroustrup documented C++'s development in his 1994 book, explaining the rationale behind language decisions. The book reveals how practical engineering constraints shaped theoretical language features.

## Continued Influence

Stroustrup remains active in C++ standardization and advocates for the language's continued evolution. He emphasizes that C++ must remain relevant for systems programming while becoming safer and more accessible.
