Walter Brattain (1902–1987) was an American physicist whose experimental work produced the first working transistor. While Bardeen provided theoretical understanding, Brattain's hands-on skill built the device that changed the world.

## Bell Labs Experimentalist

Brattain joined Bell Labs in 1929 and became known for his experimental skill with semiconductor surfaces. His patient, methodical approach to experiments complemented Bardeen's theoretical work.

## Building the First Transistor

Working closely with Bardeen in late 1947, Brattain constructed the point-contact transistor. On December 23, 1947, he demonstrated amplification of an electrical signal—the first working transistor. His lab notebook entry documenting the experiment became a historic document.

## Nobel Prize

Brattain shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics with Bardeen and Shockley. In his Nobel lecture, he emphasized the collaborative nature of the work and the importance of combining theory with experiment.

## Later Career

After the transistor, Brattain continued research at Bell Labs and later at Whitman College. He remained modest about his achievement, once saying he was "the lucky one" who happened to do the final experiment.

## Legacy

Brattain exemplified the skilled experimentalist—someone who could translate theoretical insights into working devices. His hands built the first device that would eventually become the basis for billions of transistors in every electronic device.
