Allen Newell (1927–1992) was an American cognitive scientist and computer scientist who pioneered the field of artificial intelligence. With Herbert A. Simon, he created the first AI programs and established the information processing theory of human cognition.

## The Birth of AI

In the mid-1950s, Newell and Simon, working at RAND Corporation, created Logic Theorist—the first program designed to simulate human problem-solving. They demonstrated it at the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, the founding moment of AI as a field.

## General Problem Solver

Following Logic Theorist, Newell and Simon developed the General Problem Solver (GPS) in 1959. GPS attempted to create a universal problem-solving machine that could work on any formalized problem. Though limited, it established the paradigm of AI as search through a problem space.

## Cognitive Science

Newell's work bridged computer science and psychology. He and Simon proposed that human cognition could be understood as information processing—the mind as a symbol-manipulating system. This "cognitive revolution" transformed psychology and founded cognitive science as a discipline.

## SOAR and Unified Theories of Cognition

Later in his career, Newell developed SOAR, a cognitive architecture attempting to model all aspects of human cognition in a single system. His 1990 book "Unified Theories of Cognition" argued for comprehensive theories that explain cognition holistically rather than studying isolated phenomena.

## Recognition

Newell received the Turing Award in 1975 (jointly with Simon) for their contributions to AI and cognitive psychology. His work established approaches to AI and cognitive science that continue to influence research today.
