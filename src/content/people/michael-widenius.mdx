Michael "Monty" Widenius (born 1962) is a Finnish-Swedish software developer who created MySQL and MariaDB. His work on open-source databases enabled the web application era.

## Creating MySQL

Widenius co-founded MySQL AB with David Axmark in 1995. He wrote the original MySQL code and led technical development. The name "MySQL" combines "My" (his daughter's name) with SQL.

## Open Source Business Model

MySQL AB pioneered the dual-licensing model:

- Free for open-source use (GPL)
- Commercial licenses for proprietary embedding

This model proved open source could be a viable business.

## The Oracle Question

When Sun (and then Oracle) acquired MySQL, Widenius worried about the database's open-source future. He unsuccessfully lobbied EU regulators to block the Oracle acquisition.

## Creating MariaDB

In 2009, Widenius forked MySQL to create MariaDB, ensuring a community-controlled, fully open-source version would continue. MariaDB is named after his younger daughter, Maria.

## Legacy

Widenius's databases power an enormous portion of the web. WordPress, one of the web's most common platforms, uses MySQL/MariaDB. His commitment to open source preserved these tools for the community.
