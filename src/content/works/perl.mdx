Perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Larry Wall. Originally designed for text processing and report generation, it became the "duct tape of the Internet" in the early web era.

## Origins

Larry Wall, a linguist and programmer, created Perl in 1987 for processing text files. He combined features from C, shell scripting, awk, and sed into a practical tool that could do all these tasks in one language.

## Design Philosophy

Perl embraces a distinctive philosophy:

- **TIMTOWTDI**: "There's More Than One Way To Do It"
- **Make easy things easy, hard things possible**
- **Natural language inspiration**: Perl's syntax mimics natural language patterns
- **Context sensitivity**: Operators behave differently in different contexts

## Key Features

Perl pioneered features now common in scripting languages:

- **Regular expressions**: First-class pattern matching
- **Associative arrays**: Hash tables built into the language
- **References**: Perl's take on pointers
- **CPAN**: Comprehensive Perl Archive Network for modules

## CGI Era Dominance

Perl powered the early web. Most CGI scripts were written in Perl, and it was the go-to language for web development until PHP and later frameworks emerged.

## Legacy

While Perl's popularity has declined, its influence persists:

- Regular expressions spread to virtually all languages
- Scripting language concepts became mainstream
- CPAN inspired package repositories like npm and PyPI
- Perl 5 continues active development
