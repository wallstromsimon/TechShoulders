V8 is Google's open-source JavaScript engine that revolutionized JavaScript performance. Created by Lars Bak, it proved JavaScript could be fast enough for complex applications, enabling modern web development.

## Origins

Google created V8 for Chrome browser, released in 2008. Lars Bak, who had worked on high-performance VMs for Java (HotSpot) and Self, led the project.

## Key Innovations

V8 introduced techniques that made JavaScript fast:

- **Just-in-time compilation**: Compile JavaScript to machine code
- **Hidden classes**: Optimize property access
- **Inline caching**: Speed up repeated operations
- **Generational garbage collection**: Efficient memory management

## Performance Revolution

Before V8, JavaScript was considered slow. V8 proved it could approach native speeds:

- Orders of magnitude faster than previous interpreters
- Enabled complex web applications
- Made server-side JavaScript (Node.js) viable

## Beyond Browsers

V8 powers JavaScript beyond Chrome:

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript
- **Electron**: Desktop applications
- **Deno**: Modern JavaScript runtime
- **Edge**: Microsoft's browser (switched from Chakra)
