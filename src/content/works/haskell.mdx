Haskell is a purely functional programming language with a strong static type system. Named after logician Haskell Curry, it emerged from academic research and has profoundly influenced programming language design.

## Origins

In 1987, researchers at a functional programming conference decided to consolidate efforts on lazy functional languages. The resulting committee created Haskell, first released in 1990, as an open standard for purely functional programming research.

## Key Features

Haskell introduced or popularized many concepts:

- **Pure functions**: No side effects by default
- **Lazy evaluation**: Expressions evaluated only when needed
- **Type classes**: Ad-hoc polymorphism
- **Monads**: Structure for handling effects and sequencing
- **Algebraic data types**: Powerful type definitions
- **Type inference**: Hindley-Milner type system

## Influence on Other Languages

Haskell's ideas spread widely:

- **Monads**: Adopted by Scala, Rust, and others
- **Type classes**: Inspired traits in Rust and Scala
- **Option/Maybe types**: Now in most modern languages
- **LINQ**: C#'s query syntax influenced by Haskell
- **Async/await**: Related to do-notation

## Practical Use

Though often seen as academic, Haskell is used in:

- Financial technology (Standard Chartered, Barclays)
- Compiler development (GHC itself, Elm, PureScript)
- Web frameworks (Yesod, Servant)
- Facebook's spam filtering (Sigma)
