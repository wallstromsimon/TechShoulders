BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a programming language designed to be easy to learn. Created at Dartmouth College, it made programming accessible to students and later powered the personal computer revolution.

## Origins

John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz created BASIC in 1964 at Dartmouth College. They wanted a language that non-science students could learn easily, democratizing access to computing.

## Design Goals

BASIC prioritized accessibility:

- Simple, English-like syntax
- Immediate feedback (interactive mode)
- Clear error messages
- No unnecessary complexity

## Personal Computing

BASIC became essential to personal computers:

- Microsoft BASIC (written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen) shipped with early PCs
- Altair BASIC launched Microsoft
- Apple, Commodore, Atari computers included BASIC
- A generation learned programming through BASIC

## Variants

BASIC spawned many dialects:

- **Microsoft BASIC**: Early PC standard
- **Visual Basic**: GUI development
- **QBASIC**: DOS era teaching tool
- **VBA**: Office automation

## Legacy

While considered primitive by modern standards, BASIC made programming accessible to millions. Many professional programmers started with BASIC, and its influence on computer education was profound.
