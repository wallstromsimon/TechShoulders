C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of C. It adds object-oriented features while maintaining C's efficiency and low-level capabilities, making it the dominant language for systems programming and performance-critical applications.

## Origins

Stroustrup began developing "C with Classes" at Bell Labs in 1979, inspired by Simula's object-oriented features but needing C's performance. The language was renamed C++ in 1983, with the "++" reflecting its evolutionary relationship to C.

## Key Features

C++ combined multiple paradigms:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Generic Programming**: Templates for type-safe code reuse
- **Low-Level Control**: Direct memory manipulation like C
- **RAII**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization for safe resource management
- **Zero-Overhead Abstraction**: High-level features without runtime cost

## Evolution

C++ has evolved through standardization:

- **C++98/03**: First ISO standards, establishing core features
- **C++11**: Major modernization with move semantics, lambdas, auto
- **C++14/17/20**: Continued evolution with concepts, ranges, coroutines

## Impact

C++ powers critical infrastructure: operating systems, browsers, game engines, databases, and embedded systems. Its influence on language design—particularly the template/generic programming model—extends to Java, C#, and Rust.
