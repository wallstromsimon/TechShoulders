RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format for publishing frequently updated content. It enabled blogs and podcasts to thrive by letting users subscribe to content without visiting individual websites.

## Origins

RSS emerged from multiple efforts in the late 1990s. Aaron Swartz contributed to the RSS 1.0 specification at age 14, helping standardize web content syndication.

## How It Works

RSS provides a machine-readable feed:

- XML format describing content
- Title, description, link for each item
- Timestamps for ordering
- Readers poll feeds for updates

## Impact on the Web

RSS enabled:

- **Blogs**: Readers could follow many blogs easily
- **Podcasts**: Audio delivered via RSS enclosures
- **News aggregation**: Collect multiple sources
- **Decentralized publishing**: No platform needed

## Decline and Persistence

RSS usage declined after Google Reader's shutdown (2013) and social media's rise. But it persists:

- Podcasts still use RSS
- Power users rely on feed readers
- Developer tools consume RSS

RSS represents the open web's vision—decentralized content distribution without platform intermediaries.
