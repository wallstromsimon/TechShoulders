ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. Built during World War II, it demonstrated that electronic computation was practical and marked the beginning of the computer age.

## Origins

ENIAC was developed at the University of Pennsylvania by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert for the U.S. Army to calculate artillery firing tables. It was unveiled in 1946.

## Technical Specifications

ENIAC was enormous by modern standards:

- 17,468 vacuum tubes
- 70,000 resistors
- 10,000 capacitors
- 30 tons weight
- 1,800 square feet floor space
- 150 kilowatts power consumption

## The First Programmers

Six women programmed ENIAC:

- Betty Holberton
- Kay McNulty
- Marlyn Meltzer
- Ruth Teitelbaum
- Jean Bartik
- Frances Spence

They developed programming techniques without manuals or prior examples, pioneering software development.

## Significance

ENIAC proved electronic digital computation was feasible. Though soon obsolete, it launched the computer industry and demonstrated the potential of programmable electronic machines.
