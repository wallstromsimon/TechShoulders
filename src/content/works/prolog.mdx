Prolog (Programming in Logic) is a logic programming language based on formal logic. Created by Alain Colmerauer, it allows programmers to express problems as logical relations, with the computer determining how to solve them.

## Origins

Colmerauer developed Prolog at the University of Aix-Marseille in 1972, building on work in automatic theorem proving. The goal was to create a practical programming language based on first-order logic.

## Key Concepts

Prolog uses a different paradigm from conventional languages:

- **Declarative**: Describe what, not how
- **Unification**: Pattern matching between terms
- **Backtracking**: Automatic search through possibilities
- **Horn clauses**: Logical statements as facts and rules
- **Query-based**: Pose questions the system answers

## How It Works

In Prolog, you define facts and rules:

- `parent(tom, mary).` — Tom is a parent of Mary
- `grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).` — X is a grandparent of Z if...

Then query: `?- grandparent(tom, Who).`

## Impact

Prolog influenced computing significantly:

- **Expert systems**: Dominant in early AI applications
- **Natural language processing**: Pattern matching for language
- **Datalog**: Query language for databases
- **Constraint logic programming**: Extensions for optimization
- **Fifth Generation Computing**: Japan's 1980s AI initiative
