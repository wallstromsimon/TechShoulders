Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum. Its emphasis on code readability and simplicity has made it one of the world's most popular languages, dominating data science, machine learning, and scripting.

## Origins

Van Rossum began developing Python in 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a language that was fun to use and easy to read, addressing frustrations with ABC, a language he had worked on previously.

## Design Philosophy

Python's philosophy is captured in "The Zen of Python":

- **Readability counts**: Code is read more often than written
- **Explicit is better than implicit**: No hidden magic
- **There should be one obvious way to do it**: Unlike Perl's motto
- **Simple is better than complex**: But complex is better than complicated

## Key Features

Python introduced concepts that influenced many languages:

- **Significant whitespace**: Indentation defines code blocks
- **Dynamic typing**: Variables don't need type declarations
- **Rich standard library**: "Batteries included"
- **Multiple paradigms**: Object-oriented, functional, procedural

## Impact

Python's impact spans multiple domains:

- **Data Science/ML**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Web Development**: Django, Flask frameworks
- **Automation**: Scripting and system administration
- **Education**: Often the first language taught in CS courses
