Forth is a stack-based programming language created by Chuck Moore. Its minimalist design and direct hardware control made it popular for embedded systems, astronomical software, and situations requiring maximum efficiency.

## Design Philosophy

Forth is radically minimalist:

- **Stack-based**: Operations work on a stack, no variables needed
- **Concatenative**: Functions compose by juxtaposition
- **Extensible**: Define new words (functions) easily
- **Interactive**: Immediate feedback like REPL
- **Tiny**: Implementations in kilobytes

## How It Works

Forth programs consist of "words" that manipulate a stack:

```forth
3 4 + .  ( pushes 3, pushes 4, adds, prints 7 )
```

New words are defined in terms of existing words, extending the language.

## Applications

Forth excels in constrained environments:

- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Astronomical telescope control
- Boot loaders (Open Firmware)
- Real-time systems

## Legacy

Forth influenced:

- PostScript (also stack-based)
- Factor and other concatenative languages
- Boot firmware on SPARC and PowerPC
- Minimalist language design philosophy
