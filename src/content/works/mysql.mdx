MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Created by Michael Widenius and David Axmark, it became the database of choice for web applications and a key component of the LAMP stack.

## Origins

Widenius and Axmark founded MySQL AB in Sweden in 1995. They wanted to create a fast, reliable database that was free for most users. MySQL was named after Widenius's daughter, My.

## Design Philosophy

MySQL prioritized:

- **Speed**: Fast reads for web workloads
- **Simplicity**: Easy to install and use
- **Reliability**: Stable for production use
- **Open source**: Free for most users

## Web Dominance

MySQL became essential to web development:

- **LAMP stack**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
- **WordPress**: World's most popular CMS uses MySQL
- **Early Facebook, Twitter, YouTube**: All used MySQL

## Acquisitions

MySQL's corporate history reflects database market consolidation:

- Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB (2008)
- Oracle acquired Sun (2010)
- MariaDB forked to preserve open development

## Impact

MySQL democratized database access. Where enterprise databases cost thousands, MySQL was free. This enabled a generation of web applications and startups that couldn't afford commercial databases.
