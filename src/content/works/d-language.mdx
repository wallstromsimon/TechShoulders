D is a systems programming language designed to modernize C and C++ while retaining their efficiency. Created by Walter Bright, it provides modern features like garbage collection and powerful metaprogramming while allowing low-level control when needed.

## Origins

Walter Bright, who had written the first native C++ compiler for DOS (Zortech C++), created D to address frustrations with C++. He wanted a language that kept C's efficiency but fixed its historical baggage.

## Key Features

D offers modern programming features:

- **Optional garbage collection**: With manual memory control available
- **Compile-time function execution (CTFE)**: Run arbitrary code at compile time
- **Powerful templates**: More capable than C++ templates
- **Built-in unit testing**: Testing is part of the language
- **Contract programming**: Preconditions, postconditions, invariants
- **Ranges**: Lazy sequences for efficient iteration

## Design Philosophy

D takes a pragmatic approach:

- Compatible with C code and ABIs
- Allows unsafe operations when needed
- Prefers compile-time over runtime
- Multiple paradigms: imperative, object-oriented, functional

## Influence

While not widely adopted, D influenced other languages:

- Rust learned from D's approach to systems programming
- D's CTFE concept appeared in other languages
- Nim drew inspiration from D's metaprogramming
