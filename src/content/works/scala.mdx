Scala is a programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming on the JVM. Created by Martin Odersky, it influenced Java's evolution and powered major big data systems.

## Origins

Martin Odersky, who had contributed to Java's generics, designed Scala to explore how functional and object-oriented programming could be unified. Released in 2004, Scala aimed to be a "scalable language"—suitable for both small scripts and large systems.

## Key Features

Scala unified paradigms:

- **Functional objects**: Everything is an object, including functions
- **Type inference**: Less verbose than Java while remaining type-safe
- **Pattern matching**: Powerful data destructuring
- **Traits**: Composable mixins for code reuse
- **Implicits**: Context-dependent conversions and parameters
- **For-comprehensions**: Elegant monadic composition

## Big Data Impact

Scala became the language of big data:

- **Apache Spark**: Dominant big data processing framework
- **Apache Kafka**: High-throughput message streaming
- **Akka**: Actor-based concurrency framework
- Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix adopted Scala extensively

## Influence on Java

Scala demonstrated features that Java later adopted:

- Lambda expressions
- Pattern matching (preview in Java 17+)
- Records
- Sealed classes
