Svelte is a JavaScript framework that shifts work from the browser to a compile step. Created by Rich Harris, it produces highly optimized vanilla JavaScript, eliminating the runtime overhead of traditional frameworks.

## Key Innovation

Unlike React or Vue, Svelte is a compiler:

- **No virtual DOM**: Direct DOM updates at runtime
- **No framework runtime**: Ships vanilla JavaScript
- **Compile-time reactivity**: State changes become surgical DOM updates
- **Smaller bundles**: No framework code included

## How It Works

Svelte compiles declarative component code into efficient imperative JavaScript. When you write `count += 1`, Svelte generates code that updates exactly the DOM elements that need changing.

## Key Features

Svelte provides modern framework features without runtime cost:

- **Reactive declarations**: `$:` marks statements that rerun when dependencies change
- **Scoped styles**: CSS scoped to components by default
- **Built-in animations**: Transitions and animations as first-class features
- **Stores**: Simple reactive state management

## SvelteKit

SvelteKit is Svelte's application framework, providing:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- File-based routing
- API endpoints

## Impact

Svelte challenged assumptions about how frameworks work. Its compile-time approach influenced other frameworks and raised questions about runtime overhead that was previously accepted.
