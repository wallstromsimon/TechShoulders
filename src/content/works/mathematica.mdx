Mathematica is a technical computing system that combines symbolic mathematics, numerical computation, visualization, and a programming language. Created by Stephen Wolfram, it revolutionized how scientists and engineers use computers for mathematical work.

## Origins

Stephen Wolfram, a physicist who earned his PhD at 20, grew frustrated with existing tools for symbolic computation. He created Mathematica to be a complete system for technical computing—not just calculation, but a new way of doing science.

## Key Features

Mathematica pioneered integrated technical computing:

- **Symbolic computation**: Manipulate formulas, not just numbers
- **Notebook interface**: Documents mixing text, code, and graphics
- **Visualization**: Automatic plotting and graphics generation
- **Pattern matching**: Powerful rule-based transformations
- **Built-in knowledge**: Mathematical functions and data built in

## The Wolfram Language

The programming language underlying Mathematica became known as the Wolfram Language. It's unusual in its emphasis on symbolic programming and its vast built-in knowledge base covering mathematics, physics, geography, and more.

## Impact

Mathematica changed technical computing:

- Standard tool in physics, mathematics, engineering
- Pioneered notebook-style computing (later Jupyter)
- Wolfram Alpha brought computation to consumers
- Influenced expectations for integrated computing environments
