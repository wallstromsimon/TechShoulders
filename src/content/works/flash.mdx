Adobe Flash (originally FutureSplash Animator, then Macromedia Flash) was a multimedia software platform for creating animations, games, and interactive content. It dominated web interactivity for over a decade before being deprecated in 2020.

## Origins

Jonathan Gay created FutureSplash Animator in 1996. Macromedia acquired it and renamed it Flash, which became the standard for web animation and interactivity.

## Capabilities

Flash enabled:

- **Vector animation**: Scalable, bandwidth-efficient graphics
- **ActionScript**: Programming language for interactivity
- **Video streaming**: YouTube originally used Flash
- **Games**: Browser-based gaming platform
- **Rich Internet Applications**: Desktop-like web experiences

## Golden Era

Flash powered:

- Early YouTube and video sites
- Interactive websites and advertisements
- Browser games (Newgrounds, Kongregate)
- Educational content
- Web-based tools and applications

## Decline

Flash's dominance ended due to:

- Steve Jobs' 2010 criticism (security, performance, battery life)
- Rise of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Mobile devices excluding Flash
- Security vulnerabilities
- Adobe's end-of-life announcement (2017)

## Legacy

Flash demonstrated the web's potential for rich interactivity. Many techniques it pioneered now exist natively in HTML5. A generation of animators, game developers, and web designers learned their craft through Flash.
