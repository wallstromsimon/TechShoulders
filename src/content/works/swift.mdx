Swift is a modern programming language created by Apple for iOS, macOS, and other platforms. Designed by Chris Lattner, it combines safety, performance, and expressiveness, replacing Objective-C as Apple's primary development language.

## Origins

Lattner started Swift development at Apple in 2010, drawing on his LLVM expertise. Swift was announced at WWDC 2014 and made open source in 2015.

## Key Features

Swift modernized Apple platform development:

- **Type safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Optionals**: Explicit null handling
- **Automatic Reference Counting**: Memory management without GC
- **Protocol-oriented**: Composition over inheritance
- **Playgrounds**: Interactive code exploration

## Design Philosophy

Swift balances competing goals:

- Safe by default, unsafe when needed
- Fast like C, expressive like scripting languages
- Modern features without abandoning performance
- Interoperable with existing Objective-C code

## Impact

Swift transformed Apple development:

- Faster to learn than Objective-C
- Safer code with fewer crashes
- Server-side Swift expanded its reach
- Influenced other language designs
