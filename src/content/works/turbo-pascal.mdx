Turbo Pascal was a revolutionary integrated development environment (IDE) and Pascal compiler created by Anders Hejlsberg at Borland. Released in 1983, it made professional programming tools affordable and influenced a generation of developers.

## Innovation

Turbo Pascal combined several breakthroughs:

- **Blazing speed**: Compiled entire programs in seconds
- **Integrated environment**: Editor, compiler, and debugger in one
- **Affordable**: $49.95 when competitors cost hundreds
- **Small footprint**: Ran on modest hardware

## Technical Achievements

Hejlsberg wrote a remarkably efficient single-pass compiler. The entire IDE fit on a single floppy disk. Compilation was so fast it felt interactive—a revelation when competing compilers took minutes.

## Impact on Industry

Turbo Pascal democratized programming:

- Made professional tools accessible to hobbyists and students
- Established the integrated development environment paradigm
- Proved software could be both good and affordable
- Created the foundation for Delphi

## Legacy

Though Turbo Pascal itself is obsolete, its influence persists:

- IDE concept became standard for all programming
- Hejlsberg went on to create Delphi, C#, and TypeScript
- Proved that language tools matter as much as languages
