Smalltalk is a pioneering object-oriented programming language developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. Created by Alan Kay and his team, it introduced many concepts that define modern programming and graphical user interfaces.

## Origins at Xerox PARC

Alan Kay conceived Smalltalk as a programming language that could be used by children. Influenced by Lisp's flexibility and Simula's object concepts, Kay and his team—including Dan Ingalls and Adele Goldberg—created a language where "everything is an object."

## Key Innovations

Smalltalk pioneered fundamental programming concepts:

- **Pure Object-Orientation**: Everything, including numbers and classes, is an object
- **Message Passing**: Objects communicate by sending messages
- **Integrated Development Environment**: First true IDE with debugger and browser
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: The architectural pattern for user interfaces
- **Live Programming**: Modify running programs without restarting

## Graphical User Interface

Smalltalk was inseparable from its graphical environment. The Smalltalk system featured overlapping windows, pop-up menus, and graphical editing—innovations that Steve Jobs famously saw during his visit to Xerox PARC and later incorporated into the Macintosh.

## Impact

Though Smalltalk itself never achieved mainstream adoption, its ideas pervade modern software: Java, Ruby, Python, and Objective-C all draw from Smalltalk's design. The IDE concept, unit testing, and agile development practices all trace back to the Smalltalk community.
