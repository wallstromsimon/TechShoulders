Light Table is an IDE that pioneered live programming—seeing code results instantly as you type. Created by Chris Granger after a successful Kickstarter campaign, it demonstrated new possibilities for development environments.

## Kickstarter Success

Light Table raised over $316,000 on Kickstarter in 2012, demonstrating strong interest in reimagining how programmers write code. It became one of the first major open-source projects funded this way.

## Key Innovations

Light Table introduced:

- **Inline evaluation**: See results next to code as you type
- **Watches**: Monitor values in real-time
- **Instarepl**: Instant REPL connected to your code
- **Connection-based editing**: Edit running applications

## Design Philosophy

Light Table aimed to make programming more immediate:

- Reduce the edit-compile-run cycle to nothing
- Show documentation and results where you need them
- Connect editing directly to running systems

## Influence

Light Table's ideas spread to:

- VS Code (some team members joined Microsoft)
- Jupyter notebooks (inline results)
- Modern IDE features (inline evaluation, watches)
- Live programming research

## Technology

Built with ClojureScript and Electron (before Electron was widely adopted), Light Table demonstrated that web technologies could create sophisticated desktop applications.

## Legacy

Though Light Table itself didn't achieve mainstream adoption, its influence on developer tools was significant. The concept of live, inline evaluation is now standard in many environments.
