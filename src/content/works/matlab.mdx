MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) is a programming platform for numerical computing, visualization, and algorithm development. Created by Cleve Moler, it became the standard tool for engineers and scientists working with matrices and mathematical computation.

## Origins

Cleve Moler created MATLAB in the late 1970s to give students access to LINPACK and EISPACK linear algebra libraries without learning Fortran. The commercial version was founded as MathWorks in 1984.

## Design Philosophy

MATLAB prioritizes:

- **Matrix operations**: Native array handling
- **Interactive exploration**: Try ideas quickly
- **Visualization**: Built-in plotting
- **Toolboxes**: Domain-specific extensions

## Key Features

MATLAB excels at:

- Matrix manipulation and linear algebra
- Signal and image processing
- Control system design
- Machine learning and deep learning
- Simulation (Simulink)

## Industry Impact

MATLAB became essential in:

- Engineering education worldwide
- Control systems and automotive
- Aerospace and defense
- Financial modeling
- Scientific research

## Ecosystem

The MATLAB ecosystem includes:

- **Simulink**: Model-based design and simulation
- **Toolboxes**: Signal Processing, Image Processing, Statistics, etc.
- **Code generation**: Deploy to C/C++, HDL, embedded systems

## Legacy

MATLAB made numerical computing accessible to non-programmers. Its influence extends to open-source alternatives like NumPy/SciPy (Python), GNU Octave, and Julia—all of which adopted MATLAB-like syntax for matrix operations.
