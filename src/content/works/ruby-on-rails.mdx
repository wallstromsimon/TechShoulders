Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that revolutionized how web apps are built. Created by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), it introduced "convention over configuration" and demonstrated that developer productivity could be dramatically improved.

## Origins

DHH extracted Rails from Basecamp, a project management tool he built at 37signals. Rather than keeping it proprietary, he open-sourced the framework in 2004.

## Key Principles

Rails introduced influential concepts:

- **Convention over configuration**: Sensible defaults reduce decisions
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid code duplication
- **MVC architecture**: Model-View-Controller separation
- **RESTful design**: Resources and HTTP verbs
- **Active Record**: Object-relational mapping pattern

## The 15-Minute Blog

DHH's demo of building a blog in 15 minutes showed Rails' productivity advantages. The video went viral and sparked intense interest in the framework.

## Impact

Rails transformed web development:

- Twitter, GitHub, Shopify initially built with Rails
- Influenced frameworks in every language
- Proved developer happiness could be a design goal
- Established patterns now considered standard
