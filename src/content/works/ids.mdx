IDS (Integrated Data Store) was the first database management system, created by Charles Bachman at General Electric in 1964. It introduced the network database model and established the concept of a DBMS as a distinct software layer.

## Historical Significance

Before IDS, programs accessed data directly through file systems. IDS introduced the revolutionary concept of a database management system—a software layer that managed data access and relationships.

## Network Data Model

IDS used a network (or CODASYL) data model:

- Records linked by pointers
- Many-to-many relationships supported
- Programs navigated through record links
- More flexible than hierarchical models

## Innovations

IDS introduced concepts that became standard:

- **Data independence**: Programs separated from physical storage
- **Schema definition**: Formal data structure description
- **Navigation**: Traversing relationships between records
- **Concurrent access**: Multiple programs accessing data

## Legacy

Though the relational model superseded network databases, IDS established that databases needed management systems. Bachman's insights about data independence and schemas influenced all subsequent database design.
