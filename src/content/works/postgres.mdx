Postgres (later PostgreSQL) is an open-source object-relational database system developed at UC Berkeley starting in 1986. Created by Michael Stonebraker as the successor to Ingres, it pioneered object-relational concepts and grew into one of the most advanced and widely-used database systems in the world.

## Origins

After the commercial success of Ingres, Michael Stonebraker returned to academia at Berkeley to explore new database ideas. In 1986, he started the POSTGRES project (Post-Ingres) to address limitations of pure relational systems<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

Where Ingres focused on implementing Codd's relational model, Postgres aimed to extend it—adding support for complex data types, user-defined functions, and sophisticated data relationships that pure relational systems couldn't easily express.

## Object-Relational Model

Postgres pioneered the object-relational paradigm:

**Complex Data Types**: Users could define custom types beyond simple integers and strings—geometric shapes, arrays, JSON, and arbitrary complex structures.

**Inheritance**: Tables could inherit from other tables, sharing columns and constraints—a concept borrowed from object-oriented programming.

**Rules and Triggers**: The system supported complex business logic within the database itself.

**Extensibility**: Developers could extend nearly every aspect of the system, adding new data types, operators, index methods, and procedural languages.

## Technical Innovations

Postgres introduced several influential ideas:

**MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)**: Postgres handles concurrent transactions without locking, providing each transaction a consistent snapshot of the database. This innovation enabled high-concurrency applications<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

**Write-Ahead Logging**: For crash recovery and reliability

**Sophisticated Query Planner**: Advanced optimization for complex queries

## From Postgres to PostgreSQL

The Berkeley Postgres project ran from 1986 to 1994. In 1996, Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen added SQL support (replacing the original POSTQUEL language), creating PostgreSQL<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

Released as open-source software, PostgreSQL grew through community development. Regular releases added features like:

- Full ACID compliance
- Point-in-time recovery
- Replication
- JSON and JSONB support
- Foreign data wrappers
- Parallel query execution

## Modern PostgreSQL

Today PostgreSQL powers applications at companies including Apple, Instagram, Spotify, and Reddit. It's the default database for many startups and powers significant portions of cloud infrastructure.

The 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey ranked PostgreSQL as the most-used database among professional developers<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>, reflecting decades of development from Stonebraker's original vision.
