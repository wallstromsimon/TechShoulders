The Dynabook was a visionary concept for a personal computer designed for children, conceived by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968. Though never built as Kay envisioned, it predicted tablets, laptops, and mobile computing decades before they existed.

## The Vision

Kay imagined a portable device the size of a notebook that children could use for learning. It would have a flat screen, wireless networking, and run educational software. The user would interact with it like a book—carrying it, reading from it, and creating with it.

## Influence on Computing

The Dynabook concept influenced the development of:

- **Laptops**: The portable personal computer concept
- **Tablets**: Kay's vision closely matches modern iPads and tablets
- **Educational Computing**: One Laptop Per Child and similar initiatives
- **User Interface Design**: The emphasis on ease of use for non-experts

## A Vision Still Unfolding

Kay has said that modern tablets and laptops approximate the Dynabook's hardware but fall short of its educational software vision. The Dynabook was never just about the device—it was about empowering children to think computationally and create their own tools.
