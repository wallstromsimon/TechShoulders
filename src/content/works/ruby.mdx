Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language designed for programmer happiness. Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan, it emphasizes human-readable code and elegant expression.

## Philosophy

Matsumoto designed Ruby around the principle of programmer happiness:

- **Principle of Least Surprise**: Behavior should match expectations
- **Everything is an object**: Pure object-orientation like Smalltalk
- **Multiple ways to do things**: Unlike Python's "one obvious way"
- **Beautiful code**: Aesthetics matter

## Key Features

Ruby incorporates ideas from multiple languages:

- **Blocks and iterators**: Elegant collection processing
- **Mixins**: Share code without inheritance complications
- **Open classes**: Modify any class at runtime
- **Metaprogramming**: Write code that writes code
- **Duck typing**: Focus on what objects can do, not what they are

## Ruby on Rails

Ruby's explosive growth came with Ruby on Rails in 2004. DHH's web framework demonstrated Ruby's metaprogramming power and attracted a passionate community. Rails popularized conventions like MVC and REST for web development.

## Impact

Ruby influenced modern programming:

- Proved that developer happiness matters
- Showed metaprogramming's practical power
- Rails became a template for web frameworks in other languages
- Inspired features in Python, JavaScript, and other languages
