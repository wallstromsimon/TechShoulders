PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. Created by Rasmus Lerdorf, it became the dominant language for dynamic websites, powering platforms like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia.

## Origins

Lerdorf created PHP in 1994 as "Personal Home Page Tools" to track visits to his online resume. What began as simple C programs evolved into a full programming language that could be embedded in HTML.

## Key Features

PHP's design prioritized web development:

- **HTML embedding**: Code mixed directly with HTML
- **Low barrier to entry**: Easy for beginners to start
- **Shared hosting support**: Runs on virtually any web host
- **Database integration**: Easy MySQL/PostgreSQL connectivity
- **Large standard library**: Built-in functions for common tasks

## Evolution

PHP evolved significantly:

- **PHP 4**: Introduced Zend Engine, improved performance
- **PHP 5**: Real object-oriented programming, PDO
- **PHP 7**: Massive performance improvements, type hints
- **PHP 8**: JIT compilation, attributes, union types

## Impact

PHP shaped the web:

- Powers approximately 78% of websites with known server-side languages
- WordPress, built on PHP, runs over 40% of all websites
- Facebook (now Meta) was built on PHP
- Democratized web development for millions of developers
