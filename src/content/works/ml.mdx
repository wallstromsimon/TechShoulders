ML (Meta Language) is a functional programming language created by Robin Milner. It pioneered type inference and influenced virtually every statically-typed functional language that followed, including Haskell, OCaml, and F#.

## Origins

Milner developed ML in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh as the metalanguage for the LCF theorem prover. He needed a language where programs could be guaranteed type-safe—essential when those programs were supposed to prove theorems.

## Key Innovations

ML introduced concepts now standard in programming:

- **Type inference**: The compiler deduces types without explicit annotations
- **Hindley-Milner type system**: Sound, complete type inference algorithm
- **Parametric polymorphism**: Generic functions that work on any type
- **Algebraic data types**: Sum types and product types
- **Pattern matching**: Destructuring data in function definitions

## Dialects

ML spawned influential dialects:

- **Standard ML (SML)**: Standardized version
- **OCaml**: ML with object-oriented features
- **F#**: ML for .NET
- **Reason**: Facebook's ML-like syntax for OCaml

## Impact

ML's type system influenced nearly every modern typed language. TypeScript, Rust, Swift, and Kotlin all show ML's influence in their type inference and algebraic data types. The Hindley-Milner algorithm remains fundamental to programming language theory.
