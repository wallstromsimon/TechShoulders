LaTeX is a document preparation system built on top of Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting system. Created by Leslie Lamport in the early 1980s, it provides a high-level markup language that makes TeX more accessible and practical for everyday use.

## Origins

While TeX provided powerful typesetting capabilities, its low-level commands were complex for most users. Lamport created LaTeX as a set of macros that abstracted common document tasks—chapters, sections, bibliographies, and cross-references—into simple commands.

## Key Features

LaTeX transformed academic document preparation:

- **Logical Markup**: Authors describe structure, not formatting
- **Automatic Numbering**: Figures, tables, and equations numbered consistently
- **Bibliography Management**: BibTeX integration for citations
- **Cross-References**: Automatic updating of references
- **Mathematical Typesetting**: Superior equation rendering inherited from TeX

## Impact on Academia

LaTeX became the standard for scientific and technical publishing, particularly in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Its ability to produce publication-quality documents with consistent formatting made it indispensable for journals and conference proceedings.

## Modern Usage

LaTeX continues to dominate academic publishing. Services like Overleaf provide collaborative online editing, while pandoc enables conversion between LaTeX and other formats. The system's longevity demonstrates the value of logical document structure over visual formatting.
