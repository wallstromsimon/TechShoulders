Plan 9 from Bell Labs was a distributed operating system developed as the successor to Unix. Created by many of the original Unix developers, it explored radical ideas about distributed computing and resource naming.

## Origins

In the late 1980s, Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and others at Bell Labs began designing a system that would address Unix's limitations. Named after the 1959 B-movie "Plan 9 from Outer Space," it was released in 1992.

## Key Innovations

Plan 9 introduced concepts ahead of their time:

- **Everything is a file**: Taken further than Unix—network connections, processes, even the GUI are files
- **9P protocol**: Unified protocol for accessing all resources
- **Namespaces**: Each process can have its own view of the file system
- **/proc**: Process information as files (later adopted by Linux)
- **UTF-8**: First OS to use UTF-8 natively

## "Worse is Better"

Plan 9 became a case study in why technically superior systems don't always win. Despite elegant design, Unix's momentum and the "good enough" principle meant Plan 9 never achieved widespread adoption.

## Legacy

Though Plan 9 isn't widely used, its ideas spread:

- Linux adopted /proc and other Plan 9 concepts
- UTF-8 became universal
- 9P protocol influenced container technology
- Continues to inspire systems researchers
