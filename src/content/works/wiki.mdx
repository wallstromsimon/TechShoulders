Wiki is a collaborative software concept invented by Ward Cunningham in 1995. The first wiki, WikiWikiWeb, allowed users to create and edit web pages directly in their browser, revolutionizing collaborative knowledge sharing.

## Origins

Cunningham created the WikiWikiWeb to complement the Portland Pattern Repository, allowing the software development community to collaboratively document design patterns. "Wiki wiki" means "quick" in Hawaiian.

## Key Innovations

The wiki concept introduced:

- **Browser editing**: Anyone could edit pages without special tools
- **WikiLinks**: CamelCase words automatically became links
- **Version history**: Track and revert changes
- **Collaborative ownership**: No single author controls content

## How It Works

Original wiki principles:

- Simple markup syntax (easier than HTML)
- Edit any page by clicking "Edit"
- Create new pages by linking to them
- Changes visible immediately

## Wikipedia and Beyond

Wiki's most famous descendant is Wikipedia (2001), which became the largest encyclopedia ever created. The wiki concept also influenced:

- Corporate knowledge bases (Confluence)
- Software documentation (GitHub wikis)
- Community collaboration platforms
- Note-taking tools (Notion, Obsidian)

## Legacy

The wiki model demonstrated that collaborative, open editing could produce valuable content. It challenged assumptions about authorship and expertise, enabling collective intelligence at scale.
