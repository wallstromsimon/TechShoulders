The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, stating that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program. Introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987, it provides the theoretical foundation for behavioral subtyping.

## Origins

In 1987, Barbara Liskov gave a keynote address at the OOPSLA conference titled "Data Abstraction and Hierarchy." In it, she articulated a principle that had emerged from years of research on abstract data types and program specification<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>:

> "What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property: If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2, then S is a subtype of T."

This formal definition captured what it means for inheritance to be used correctly.

## The Principle Explained

In practical terms, the Liskov Substitution Principle means:

- A subclass should be usable anywhere its parent class is expected
- Subclasses should not strengthen preconditions (require more than the parent)
- Subclasses should not weaken postconditions (promise less than the parent)
- Subclasses should preserve invariants established by the parent

## Classic Violation: Square and Rectangle

The most famous LSP violation involves squares and rectangles:

A `Square` seems like it should inherit from `Rectangle`—after all, a square is a rectangle mathematically. But if `Rectangle` has independent `setWidth` and `setHeight` methods, `Square` cannot properly inherit them without violating the principle. Setting a square's width must also change its height, which violates the rectangle's implicit contract<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

This example shows that inheritance should model behavioral compatibility, not just conceptual "is-a" relationships.

## Impact

The Liskov Substitution Principle became one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design (the "L" in SOLID). It provides:

- **Design guidance**: Helps identify when inheritance is appropriate
- **Correctness criteria**: Programs that follow LSP are more likely to work correctly when types change
- **API design insight**: Informs decisions about method contracts and class hierarchies

## Legacy

Liskov and Jeannette Wing formalized the principle more rigorously in their 1994 paper "A Behavioral Notion of Subtyping." The principle remains a cornerstone of object-oriented design education and practice.
