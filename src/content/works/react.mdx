React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created at Facebook. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM transformed how web applications are built and influenced virtually every UI framework that followed.

## Origins

Jordan Walke created React at Facebook in 2011 to solve challenges with Facebook's complex, ever-changing UI. It was open-sourced in 2013 and quickly gained adoption.

## Key Innovations

React introduced concepts that became standard:

- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient UI updates through reconciliation
- **Component-based architecture**: Reusable, composable UI pieces
- **Declarative UI**: Describe what should render, not how
- **JSX**: HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- **One-way data flow**: Predictable state management

## Evolution

React has evolved significantly:

- **Hooks (2019)**: Simpler state and effects without classes
- **Concurrent Mode**: Better handling of updates
- **Server Components (2023)**: React on the server
- **Suspense**: Declarative loading states

## Impact

React's influence is pervasive:

- Most popular UI library by adoption
- React Native brought it to mobile
- Inspired Vue, Svelte, and others
- Established component-based development as the standard
- Created enormous ecosystem of tools and libraries
