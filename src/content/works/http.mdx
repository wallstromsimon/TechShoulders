HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Designed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989–1991, HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

## Origins

When Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, he needed a protocol for clients (browsers) and servers to communicate. HTTP was designed to be simple and human-readable—a request-response protocol where clients ask for resources and servers provide them<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

The first version, HTTP/0.9, was remarkably simple: a client sent a single line requesting a document, and the server returned the content. No headers, no metadata, no status codes—just the document itself.

## How HTTP Works

HTTP follows a request-response model:

1. **Client sends request**: Specifies a method (GET, POST, etc.), a URL, and optional headers
2. **Server processes request**: Locates the resource and determines how to respond
3. **Server sends response**: Returns a status code, headers, and the requested content

The protocol is stateless—each request is independent, with no memory of previous interactions. This simplicity made HTTP scalable to billions of users.

## Evolution

HTTP has evolved to meet growing demands<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>:

- **HTTP/0.9 (1991)**: Original single-line protocol
- **HTTP/1.0 (1996)**: Added headers, status codes, and multiple content types
- **HTTP/1.1 (1997)**: Persistent connections, chunked transfers, and caching
- **HTTP/2 (2015)**: Binary protocol, multiplexing, and header compression
- **HTTP/3 (2022)**: Built on QUIC for improved performance over unreliable networks

## Key Concepts

### Methods

HTTP defines several request methods:

- **GET**: Retrieve a resource (the most common method)
- **POST**: Submit data to be processed
- **PUT**: Replace a resource
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource
- **HEAD**: Retrieve headers only

### Status Codes

Servers respond with three-digit status codes:

- **200 OK**: Request succeeded
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Resource has a new URL
- **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server failed to process the request

## Impact

HTTP's simplicity enabled the Web's explosive growth. Unlike complex protocols designed by committee, HTTP was pragmatic—easy to implement, debug, and extend<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>.

Today, HTTP carries not just web pages but APIs, streaming media, real-time communications, and virtually all modern internet applications. It has become the universal language of networked computing.
