OCaml (Objective Caml) is a functional programming language that extends ML with object-oriented features. Created at INRIA in France, it combines functional programming's elegance with practical performance and has influenced languages from Rust to F#.

## Origins

Xavier Leroy led the development of OCaml at INRIA, building on earlier work on Caml. The goal was to create a practical, efficient functional language suitable for real-world software development.

## Key Features

OCaml combines functional programming with pragmatic features:

- **Strong type inference**: Rarely need explicit type annotations
- **Pattern matching**: Elegant handling of algebraic data types
- **Efficient compilation**: Native code performance rivaling C
- **Object system**: Classes and objects when needed
- **Module system**: Sophisticated code organization
- **Polymorphic variants**: Flexible extensible types

## Notable Uses

OCaml powers significant projects:

- **Jane Street**: Major financial firm uses OCaml extensively
- **Facebook/Meta**: Used for Hack type checker and Flow
- **Coq**: Proof assistant written in OCaml
- **MirageOS**: Unikernel operating system

## Influence

OCaml's ideas spread to other languages:

- **F#**: Microsoft's .NET ML dialect based on OCaml
- **Rust**: Pattern matching and type system influenced by OCaml
- **Reason**: Facebook's alternative syntax for OCaml
- **ReScript**: OCaml-based JavaScript compiler
