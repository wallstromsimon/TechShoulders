C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of .NET. Designed by Anders Hejlsberg, it combines the power of C++ with the productivity of modern languages.

## Origins

Microsoft developed C# as part of its .NET initiative, announced in 2000. Hejlsberg, who had created Turbo Pascal and Delphi at Borland, led the language design. C# was influenced by C++, Java, and Delphi.

## Key Features

C# introduced and popularized many features:

- **Language Integrated Query (LINQ)**: Query syntax built into the language
- **Async/await**: Clean asynchronous programming
- **Properties**: First-class getter/setter syntax
- **Generics**: Type-safe generic programming
- **Nullable types**: Explicit handling of null values

## Evolution

C# has evolved rapidly:

- **C# 2.0**: Generics, anonymous methods
- **C# 3.0**: LINQ, lambda expressions
- **C# 5.0**: Async/await pattern
- **C# 7-11**: Pattern matching, records, improved performance

## Impact

C# powers diverse applications:

- **Windows development**: Native platform for Windows apps
- **Unity**: Dominant game development engine uses C#
- **Web**: ASP.NET for server-side development
- **Cross-platform**: .NET Core brought C# beyond Windows
