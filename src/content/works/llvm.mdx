LLVM is a compiler infrastructure project that revolutionized how compilers are built. Started by Chris Lattner, it provides reusable components for creating language compilers, enabling new programming languages to leverage sophisticated optimizations.

## Origins

Lattner started LLVM as a research project at the University of Illinois. The name originally stood for "Low Level Virtual Machine," though the project grew beyond that scope.

## Key Innovation

LLVM introduced modular compiler architecture:

- **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: Common format between languages and targets
- **Reusable passes**: Optimization and analysis modules
- **Target-independent**: Same optimizations work across architectures
- **Library-based**: Use only what you need

## Impact on Languages

LLVM enabled a proliferation of new languages:

- **Rust**: Uses LLVM for code generation
- **Swift**: Built on LLVM from the start
- **Julia**: Scientific computing language
- **Kotlin/Native**: Native compilation via LLVM

## Clang

Clang, LLVM's C/C++ frontend, became a major compiler:

- Faster compilation than GCC
- Better error messages
- Used by Apple, Google, and others
- Foundation for code analysis tools
