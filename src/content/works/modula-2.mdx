Modula-2 is a systems programming language designed by Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zurich, first published in 1978. Building on Pascal, it added modules for large-scale program organization, low-level facilities for systems programming, and coroutines for concurrent programming.

## Origins

After designing Pascal, Wirth worked on the Lilith workstation project at ETH Zurich. He needed a language suitable for writing an operating system while maintaining Pascal's elegant structure. The result was Modula-2 (following an earlier experimental language called Modula)<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

## Key Innovations

Modula-2 extended Pascal with several important features:

**Modules**: The language's namesake feature allowed programs to be divided into separate compilation units with explicit interfaces. A module could export only specific identifiers, hiding implementation details. This was a major advance for building large software systems.

**Low-level facilities**: Unlike Pascal, Modula-2 provided controlled access to machine-level operations—necessary for writing operating systems and device drivers while maintaining type safety where possible.

**Coroutines**: Built-in support for coroutines enabled concurrent programming, essential for the Lilith operating system.

**Procedure variables**: First-class procedure types allowed more flexible programming patterns.

## The Lilith Workstation

Modula-2 was developed alongside the Lilith personal workstation (1978-1980). The entire Lilith system—including the operating system, compiler, and applications—was written in Modula-2, demonstrating that a high-level language could replace assembly for systems programming<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

## Influence

Modula-2's module system influenced many later languages:

- **Ada**: Adopted similar package/module concepts
- **Oberon**: Wirth's successor language refined the ideas further
- **Modern languages**: The principle of explicit module interfaces became standard
