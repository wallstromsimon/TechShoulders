Erlang is a functional programming language designed for building massively scalable, fault-tolerant systems. Created at Ericsson for telecommunications, it pioneered the actor model and "let it crash" philosophy that influenced modern distributed systems.

## Origins

Joe Armstrong and colleagues at Ericsson developed Erlang in the 1980s to handle telephone switching systems. These systems required extreme reliability—"five nines" uptime (99.999%)—and the ability to update code without stopping.

## Key Features

Erlang introduced concepts for building reliable systems:

- **Actor model**: Lightweight processes communicate via message passing
- **Immutability**: No shared mutable state eliminates race conditions
- **Pattern matching**: Elegant data destructuring
- **Hot code swapping**: Update running systems without downtime
- **Supervision trees**: Automatic restart of failed processes
- **"Let it crash"**: Design for failure, not just success

## The BEAM

Erlang runs on the BEAM virtual machine, designed for:

- Millions of lightweight processes
- Soft real-time performance
- Distributed computing primitives
- Fault isolation between processes

## Impact

Erlang's influence extends beyond telecom:

- WhatsApp handled billions of messages with tiny team using Erlang
- RabbitMQ message broker built on Erlang
- Elixir brought Erlang's runtime to modern syntax
- Inspired actor systems in Akka (Scala) and others
