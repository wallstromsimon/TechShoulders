Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a web server known for high performance, stability, and low resource consumption. Created by Igor Sysoev, it challenged Apache's dominance and now powers a significant portion of the world's websites.

## Origins

Sysoev began developing Nginx in 2002 to solve the C10K problem—handling 10,000 concurrent connections. Apache's process-per-connection model struggled at scale; Nginx used an event-driven, asynchronous architecture.

## Key Architecture

Nginx's design enables high concurrency:

- **Event-driven**: Non-blocking I/O handling
- **Master-worker model**: One master, multiple workers
- **Asynchronous**: Handle many connections per worker
- **Low memory**: Efficient resource usage

## Features

Beyond serving static files, Nginx provides:

- **Reverse proxy**: Route requests to backend servers
- **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic across servers
- **SSL termination**: Handle HTTPS connections
- **Caching**: Cache responses for performance
- **HTTP/2 support**: Modern protocol support

## Adoption

Nginx became critical infrastructure:

- Second most popular web server globally
- Powers Netflix, Dropbox, WordPress.com
- Standard for container-based deployments
- Essential component in modern architectures
