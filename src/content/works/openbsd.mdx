OpenBSD is a security-focused, free Unix-like operating system. Created by Theo de Raadt after forking from NetBSD, it's renowned for code correctness, security, and producing widely-used portable software like OpenSSH.

## Security Focus

OpenBSD pioneered security practices:

- **Proactive security auditing**: Continuous code review
- **Secure by default**: Minimal services enabled
- **W^X**: Write XOR Execute memory protection
- **Privilege separation**: Isolate dangerous operations
- **Randomization**: Address space layout randomization

## Only Two Remote Holes

OpenBSD's famous claim—"Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!"—reflects its security-focused development. The number has increased slightly but remains remarkably low.

## Portable Software

OpenBSD produces widely-used tools:

- **OpenSSH**: Secure shell, used everywhere
- **LibreSSL**: OpenSSL fork after Heartbleed
- **OpenBGPD**: Border Gateway Protocol daemon
- **PF**: Packet filter firewall

## Impact

OpenBSD's security innovations spread to other systems:

- OpenSSH became the standard SSH implementation
- Security practices influenced Linux and other BSDs
- W^X and ASLR adopted industry-wide
