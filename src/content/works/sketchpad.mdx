Sketchpad was the first graphical computer program, created by Ivan Sutherland for his PhD thesis. It introduced concepts foundational to computer-aided design (CAD), graphical user interfaces, and object-oriented programming.

## Revolutionary Interaction

Sketchpad allowed users to draw directly on a display screen using a light pen. This was revolutionary—most computers at the time used punch cards and printed output.

## Key Innovations

Sketchpad introduced concepts that became fundamental:

- **Direct manipulation**: Draw and modify on screen
- **Constraint satisfaction**: Lines stay connected when moved
- **Master drawings**: Reusable components (like objects/classes)
- **Zooming**: Scale drawings up and down
- **Copy and instance**: Duplicate with maintained relationships

## Object-Oriented Concepts

Sketchpad's "master drawings" anticipated object-oriented programming:

- Masters defined structure and behavior
- Instances inherited properties from masters
- Changes to masters propagated to instances

## Impact

Sketchpad influenced:

- CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems
- Graphical user interfaces
- Object-oriented programming
- Virtual reality research

Sutherland received the Turing Award in 1988 for this pioneering work.
