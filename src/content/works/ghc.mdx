The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is the leading implementation of Haskell, developed at the University of Glasgow. It has become both a production-quality compiler and a research vehicle for programming language innovation.

## Origins

GHC began in 1989 at Glasgow University. Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow became its primary architects, developing it into the definitive Haskell implementation.

## Technical Innovations

GHC pioneered many compiler techniques:

- **Type classes**: Advanced type system features
- **Software transactional memory**: Composable concurrency
- **Lazy evaluation**: Efficient implementation of non-strict semantics
- **Core intermediate language**: Small, typed representation

## Language Extensions

GHC has served as a testbed for language features:

- Generalized algebraic data types (GADTs)
- Type families and data families
- Template Haskell (compile-time metaprogramming)
- Linear types (experimental)

## Ecosystem

GHC supports:

- **Cabal/Stack**: Build tools
- **Hackage**: Package repository
- **GHCi**: Interactive interpreter
- **Cross-compilation**: Multiple platforms

## Research Impact

Many programming language research papers prototype ideas in GHC:

- Effect systems
- Dependent types
- Parallel and concurrent programming
- Type-level programming

## Legacy

GHC demonstrates that a research compiler can become production-ready while continuing to advance the state of the art. It has influenced type systems in Rust, TypeScript, and other mainstream languages.
