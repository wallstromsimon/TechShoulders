Apache HTTP Server (commonly "Apache") is a free and open-source web server that powered the growth of the World Wide Web. For years the most popular web server, it established the open-source infrastructure model.

## Origins

Apache emerged in 1995 from patches to the NCSA HTTPd server. A group of developers formed the Apache Group to maintain and improve the server. The name punned on "a patchy server."

## Key Features

Apache provided essential web server capabilities:

- **Virtual hosting**: Multiple sites on one server
- **URL rewriting**: Flexible URL handling
- **Authentication**: Access control
- **Modules**: Extensible architecture
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure connections
- **.htaccess**: Directory-level configuration

## Dominance

Apache dominated the web server market:

- Over 70% market share at its peak
- Powered the dot-com era
- Part of the LAMP stack
- Proved open source could compete

## The Apache Foundation

The Apache Software Foundation, grown from Apache HTTP Server development, became a major home for open-source projects: Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, Tomcat, and many others.
