Quicksort is a highly efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare in 1959. It remains one of the most widely used sorting algorithms due to its excellent average-case performance and cache efficiency.

## How It Works

Quicksort uses a divide-and-conquer strategy:

1. Choose a "pivot" element from the array
2. Partition: rearrange elements so smaller values go left of pivot, larger go right
3. Recursively apply to the sub-arrays on each side

## Performance Characteristics

- **Average case**: O(n log n)
- **Worst case**: O(n²) with poor pivot selection
- **Space**: O(log n) auxiliary space for recursion
- **In-place**: Sorts without additional array allocation

## Why It's Fast in Practice

Despite O(n²) worst case, Quicksort often outperforms O(n log n) algorithms:

- Excellent cache locality
- Low overhead compared to merge sort
- Randomized pivot selection avoids worst case
- Inner loop is simple and fast

## Influence

Quicksort influenced:

- Standard library sort implementations (C's qsort, Java Arrays.sort)
- Pivot selection strategies
- Hybrid algorithms like Introsort
- Analysis of randomized algorithms
