Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems, developed by Tony Hoare and published in 1978. It provides a mathematical framework for reasoning about concurrent programs.

## Core Concepts

CSP models concurrent systems as independent processes that interact through message passing:

- **Processes**: Independent sequential components
- **Channels**: Named communication pathways
- **Events**: Synchronous communications between processes
- **Choice**: Non-deterministic selection between events

## Mathematical Foundation

CSP provides:

- Algebraic operators for composing processes
- Formal semantics for reasoning about behavior
- Methods to prove absence of deadlock
- Techniques for refinement verification

## Influence on Programming Languages

CSP directly influenced:

- **Go**: Goroutines and channels derive from CSP
- **Occam**: Language built directly on CSP model
- **Erlang**: Process-based concurrency with message passing
- **Clojure core.async**: CSP-style channels

## Legacy

CSP demonstrated that complex concurrent systems could be reasoned about formally. Its concepts of channels and message-passing became standard tools for concurrent programming, offering an alternative to shared-memory approaches.
