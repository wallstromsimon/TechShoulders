BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) was a Unix operating system developed at UC Berkeley. It introduced critical innovations including TCP/IP networking, the vi editor, and the BSD license that enabled open-source software.

## Origins

The Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group, led by researchers including Bill Joy, began distributing modifications to Unix in 1977. These distributions included new utilities, improved performance, and eventually a complete operating system.

## Key Innovations

BSD introduced fundamental computing technologies:

- **TCP/IP stack**: The networking code that powers the internet
- **vi editor**: Standard Unix text editor
- **C shell (csh)**: Alternative command shell
- **Fast File System (FFS)**: Improved file system performance
- **Virtual memory**: BSD's VM implementation

## TCP/IP and the Internet

BSD's TCP/IP implementation, funded by DARPA, became the reference implementation of internet protocols. This code spread to virtually every operating system and enabled the internet's growth.

## BSD License

The BSD license allowed code to be used in proprietary products, unlike the GPL's copyleft. This permissive approach enabled:

- macOS (derived from FreeBSD)
- PlayStation OS
- WhatsApp servers
- Many embedded systems
