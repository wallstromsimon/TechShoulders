Vite is a build tool that significantly improves the web development experience. Created by Evan You, it uses native ES modules for instant server start and lightning-fast hot module replacement.

## The Problem

Traditional bundlers like webpack bundle all code before starting the dev server. As applications grew, startup times stretched to minutes. Developers waited longer and longer just to see their changes.

## The Solution

Vite takes a different approach:

- **Native ES modules**: Serve source code directly to the browser
- **On-demand compilation**: Only transform files when requested
- **esbuild pre-bundling**: Use the fastest bundler for dependencies
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Near-instant updates without page reload

## Key Features

Vite revolutionized development experience:

- **Instant server start**: No bundling required
- **Fast HMR**: Updates in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Framework agnostic**: Works with Vue, React, Svelte, and more
- **Production builds**: Uses Rollup for optimized output

## Impact

Vite's success changed expectations:

- Adopted by Vue, Svelte, and many projects
- Inspired similar approaches in other tools
- Made slow dev servers unacceptable
- Showed that DX (developer experience) innovations matter
