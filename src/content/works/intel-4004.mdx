The Intel 4004 was the first commercially available microprocessor—a complete CPU on a single chip. Released in 1971, it launched the microprocessor revolution that put computing power in everything from calculators to spacecraft.

## Origins

The 4004 was designed by Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, and Stanley Mazor at Intel for Busicom, a Japanese calculator company. Rather than designing custom chips, Hoff proposed a general-purpose processor that could be programmed for different functions.

## Technical Specifications

The 4004 was modest by later standards:

- 4-bit processor
- 2,300 transistors
- 740 kHz clock speed
- 10 micron process

Yet it contained all the fundamental components of a CPU: arithmetic logic unit, control unit, and registers.

## Significance

The 4004 proved that a complete processor could fit on a single chip. This enabled:

- Programmable calculators
- Early personal computers
- Embedded systems in appliances
- The entire microprocessor industry

## Legacy

Intel went on to dominate the microprocessor market. The 4004's descendants—the 8080, 8086, and x86 family—became the foundation of the PC industry. The concept of a general-purpose microprocessor, rather than custom hardware, transformed electronics.
