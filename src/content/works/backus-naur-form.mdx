Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a formal notation for describing the syntax of programming languages. Developed by John Backus and refined by Peter Naur in 1959-1960 for the ALGOL 60 specification, BNF provided the first rigorous way to define what constitutes a valid program in a language.

## Origins

When the international committee designing ALGOL 60 needed to specify the language precisely, Backus introduced a notation he had developed while working on FORTRAN. Peter Naur refined it for the ALGOL 60 report, and the notation became known as Backus-Naur Form (originally "Backus Normal Form")<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

## The Notation

BNF uses a simple but powerful formalism:

```
<expression> ::= <term> | <expression> "+" <term>
<term> ::= <factor> | <term> "*" <factor>
<factor> ::= <number> | "(" <expression> ")"
```

This example defines arithmetic expressions with proper operator precedence. The notation uses:

- **`<...>`**: Non-terminal symbols (to be further defined)
- **`::=`**: "Is defined as"
- **`|`**: "Or" (alternative productions)
- **Quoted strings**: Literal terminal symbols

## Impact

BNF transformed programming language design:

- **Precision**: For the first time, language syntax could be defined unambiguously
- **Parser generation**: BNF grammars can be mechanically converted into parsers
- **Communication**: Language designers could share specifications precisely
- **Theory foundation**: BNF established connections to formal language theory and context-free grammars

## Extensions and Legacy

BNF spawned many variants:

- **Extended BNF (EBNF)**: Added repetition and optional elements
- **ABNF**: Used in internet standards (RFCs)
- **Parser generators**: Tools like yacc, bison, and ANTLR use BNF-like notation

Every modern programming language specification uses some form of BNF notation. It remains the standard way to formally define language syntax.
