The Xerox Alto was the first computer designed for individual use with a graphical user interface. Developed at Xerox PARC, it pioneered concepts that defined personal computing but was never sold commercially.

## Revolutionary Design

The Alto introduced paradigms we now take for granted:

- **Bitmapped display**: Individual pixels, not character cells
- **Graphical user interface**: Windows, icons, menus
- **Mouse**: Primary input device
- **WYSIWYG editing**: Print output matches screen
- **Ethernet**: Network connectivity

## Technical Specifications

The Alto was advanced for its time:

- Custom bit-slice processor
- 128KB-512KB RAM
- Removable hard disk
- High-resolution display (606 x 808)

## Influence on Apple

Steve Jobs famously visited PARC and saw Alto demonstrations. The visit influenced the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, bringing PARC's innovations to the commercial market.

## Why Xerox Didn't Commercialize

Xerox never successfully commercialized the Alto:

- Seen as too expensive for consumers
- Corporate focus on copiers
- Failure to recognize market potential

The Alto demonstrated what personal computing could be; Apple and Microsoft built the industry.
