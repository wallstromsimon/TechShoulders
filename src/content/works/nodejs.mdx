Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that executes JavaScript outside the browser. Created by Ryan Dahl, it enabled full-stack JavaScript development and transformed how server applications are built.

## Origins

Ryan Dahl created Node.js in 2009, frustrated by how web servers handled concurrent connections. Traditional servers blocked on I/O operations; Dahl used JavaScript's event-driven model for non-blocking I/O.

## Key Innovations

Node.js introduced concepts that changed server development:

- **Event-driven**: Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
- **V8 engine**: Chrome's fast JavaScript engine on servers
- **Single-threaded event loop**: Handle thousands of connections efficiently
- **npm**: Package manager that became the largest in the world

## Impact on Web Development

Node.js transformed the industry:

- **Full-stack JavaScript**: Same language on client and server
- **npm ecosystem**: Millions of packages for any task
- **Real-time applications**: WebSocket servers, chat applications
- **Build tools**: Webpack, Babel, ESLint written in Node
- **Serverless**: Lambda functions often run Node.js

## Criticisms and Evolution

Dahl later acknowledged design regrets (callback hell, security, package management), leading him to create Deno. Node.js has evolved with async/await, ES modules, and better security features.
