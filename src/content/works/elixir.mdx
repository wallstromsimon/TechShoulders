Elixir is a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang VM (BEAM). Created by José Valim, it brings modern syntax and developer ergonomics to Erlang's battle-tested runtime for building scalable, fault-tolerant applications.

## Origins

José Valim, a core contributor to Ruby on Rails, created Elixir after exploring concurrency challenges. He wanted Erlang's reliability and concurrency but with better tooling and a more approachable syntax.

## Key Features

Elixir combines Erlang's strengths with modern features:

- **Pattern matching**: Elegant destructuring and control flow
- **Pipe operator**: Chain transformations readably
- **Macros**: Metaprogramming for extending the language
- **Mix**: Modern build tool and package manager
- **Protocols**: Polymorphism without inheritance
- **Comprehensions**: Declarative iteration

## Phoenix Framework

The Phoenix web framework showed Elixir's potential:

- Real-time features with Channels (WebSockets)
- Millions of concurrent connections possible
- LiveView: server-rendered real-time interfaces
- Performance competitive with Go and Node.js

## Impact

Elixir expanded Erlang's reach:

- Made BEAM accessible to web developers
- Proved functional programming could be approachable
- Phoenix became a major web framework
- Attracted developers from Ruby and other communities
