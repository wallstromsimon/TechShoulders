QEMU is a generic machine emulator and virtualizer. Created by Fabrice Bellard, it can emulate various CPU architectures and serves as the foundation for KVM virtualization, powering much of cloud computing.

## Capabilities

QEMU operates in two main modes:

- **Full system emulation**: Emulate entire machines including CPU, memory, and devices
- **User mode emulation**: Run programs compiled for different architectures

## Technical Innovations

QEMU introduced sophisticated techniques:

- **Dynamic binary translation**: Convert guest code to host code at runtime
- **Tiny Code Generator (TCG)**: Portable intermediate representation
- **Device emulation**: Virtual hardware implementation
- **Copy-on-write images**: Efficient disk image management

## KVM Integration

QEMU combined with KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) provides:

- Near-native performance for Linux guests on Linux hosts
- Hardware-assisted virtualization
- Foundation for cloud computing infrastructure

## Impact

QEMU underlies much of modern computing:

- Basis for cloud platforms (AWS, GCP use KVM)
- Development and testing of operating systems
- Cross-platform development
- Security research and analysis
