The Nyquist sampling theorem, established through Harry Nyquist's 1928 paper "Certain Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory," is a fundamental principle stating that a continuous signal can be perfectly reconstructed from discrete samples if the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency in the signal. This theorem is the theoretical foundation of all digital audio, video, and communications.

## Background

In the 1920s, the telecommunications industry faced fundamental questions about the limits of signal transmission. How fast could data be sent through a telegraph line? What determined the quality of transmitted signals?

Harry Nyquist, working at AT&T and later Bell Labs, addressed these questions through mathematical analysis. His 1924 paper "Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed" and 1928 paper "Certain Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory" established principles that would prove essential to the digital age<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

## The Theorem

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states:

> A continuous band-limited signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency component in the signal.

This minimum sampling rate is called the **Nyquist rate**. Sampling below this rate causes **aliasing**—the misrepresentation of high frequencies as lower frequencies, resulting in distortion that cannot be corrected<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

## Mathematical Foundation

For a signal with maximum frequency f_max:

- **Nyquist rate** = 2 × f_max
- Sampling must occur at intervals no greater than 1/(2 × f_max)

For example, human hearing extends to approximately 20 kHz, so audio must be sampled at least 40,000 times per second to capture all audible frequencies. CD audio uses 44.1 kHz, providing margin above the theoretical minimum.

## Influence on Information Theory

Nyquist's work directly influenced Claude Shannon's foundational information theory. Shannon's landmark 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" cites Nyquist's papers in its opening paragraph, acknowledging their "seminal role in the development of information theory"<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>.

While Nyquist stated the theorem, Shannon provided the rigorous mathematical proof and extended it to include noise considerations.

## Applications

The sampling theorem is fundamental to virtually all digital technology:

### Digital Audio

- **CD audio**: 44.1 kHz sampling rate (2.2× the 20 kHz upper limit of hearing)
- **DVD audio**: Up to 192 kHz for higher fidelity
- **Digital telephone**: 8 kHz (voice frequencies up to 4 kHz)

### Digital Video

- Frame rates and resolution depend on Nyquist principles
- Video compression algorithms apply spatial sampling theorems

### Telecommunications

- Digital cellular networks
- VoIP (Voice over IP)
- Digital subscriber lines (DSL)

### Medical Imaging

- MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound rely on proper sampling
- Undersampling creates aliasing artifacts in images

### Scientific Measurement

- Seismology, astronomy, and physics instrumentation
- Any analog-to-digital conversion

## The Name

The theorem is variously called the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, Shannon sampling theorem, or Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov theorem. The multiple names reflect a complex history:

- E.T. Whittaker described related mathematical concepts in 1915
- Nyquist established the practical engineering principles in 1928
- Vladimir Kotelnikov proved the theorem independently in 1933
- Shannon provided the definitive proof and context in 1949

## Legacy

The Nyquist sampling theorem demonstrated that continuous signals could be converted to discrete samples without loss of information—the conceptual basis for the digital revolution. Every digital recording, every digital communication, every digital image depends on principles Nyquist established nearly a century ago.
