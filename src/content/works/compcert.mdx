CompCert is a formally verified C compiler developed by Xavier Leroy and collaborators. Unlike conventional compilers that may have bugs, CompCert comes with a mathematical proof that it correctly compiles C code, making it suitable for safety-critical systems.

## The Problem

Compilers are complex programs that can have bugs. A compiler bug might silently transform correct source code into incorrect machine code. For safety-critical software (medical devices, aircraft, nuclear reactors), this is unacceptable.

## The Solution

CompCert is written in Coq, a proof assistant that allows mathematical proofs about programs. The compiler comes with a machine-checked proof that the generated assembly code behaves exactly as the source code specifies.

## What's Proven

CompCert's proof guarantees that if a source program has defined behavior, the compiled program has the same observable behavior. This covers all the complex transformations a compiler performs: parsing, optimization, register allocation, code generation.

## Impact

CompCert demonstrated that verified compilation is practical:

- Used in aerospace and other safety-critical industries
- Showed formal methods could scale to realistic programs
- Found bugs in other "production" compilers
- Inspired verified systems research (seL4, CertiKOS)

## Ongoing Development

Leroy and collaborators continue developing CompCert, adding support for more C features and processor architectures. It represents a milestone in applying formal methods to practical software.
