FORMAC (FORmula MAnipulation Compiler) was the first widely used computer language for symbolic mathematics. Created by Jean Sammet at IBM, it allowed computers to manipulate mathematical formulas, not just numbers.

## Significance

Before FORMAC, computers primarily processed numerical data. FORMAC enabled manipulation of algebraic expressions—adding, multiplying, differentiating, and simplifying formulas symbolically.

## Key Capabilities

FORMAC could:

- Differentiate and integrate symbolically
- Simplify algebraic expressions
- Substitute and expand formulas
- Handle polynomial arithmetic

## Impact

FORMAC pioneered computer algebra:

- First widely used symbolic math system
- Demonstrated computers could do "real" mathematics
- Influenced Macsyma, Mathematica, and modern CAS systems

## Historical Context

FORMAC was built on FORTRAN, extending it with symbolic capabilities. Its success showed that programming languages could be specialized for particular domains—a concept now taken for granted.
