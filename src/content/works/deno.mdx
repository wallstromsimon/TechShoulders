Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime created by Ryan Dahl to address what he saw as Node.js's design mistakes. It features first-class TypeScript support, secure-by-default permissions, and modern JavaScript features.

## Origins

In a famous 2018 talk "10 Things I Regret About Node.js," Dahl announced Deno as a fresh approach to server-side JavaScript. The name is an anagram of "Node."

## Key Differences from Node.js

Deno addresses Node.js pain points:

- **Secure by default**: No file/network access without explicit permission
- **TypeScript native**: Run TypeScript without configuration
- **ES modules only**: No CommonJS confusion
- **URL imports**: Import from URLs, no package.json required
- **Built-in tools**: Formatter, linter, test runner included
- **Web-compatible**: Browser APIs where possible

## Design Philosophy

Deno prioritizes:

- Security through explicit permissions
- Simplicity through built-in tooling
- Standards compliance with web APIs
- Modern JavaScript features

## Impact

Deno influenced Node.js to add features like ES modules and a permission model. It demonstrated that runtime design could be rethought, and that TypeScript could be first-class.
