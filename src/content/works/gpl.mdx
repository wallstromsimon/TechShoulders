The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free software license that guarantees users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify software. Created by Richard Stallman, it pioneered "copyleft"—using copyright law to ensure software freedom propagates.

## The Four Freedoms

The GPL ensures users have:

- **Freedom 0**: Run the program for any purpose
- **Freedom 1**: Study and modify the source code
- **Freedom 2**: Redistribute copies
- **Freedom 3**: Distribute modified versions

## Copyleft Innovation

The GPL's key innovation is copyleft: derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL. This creates a "viral" effect—GPL code can only be combined with GPL-compatible code, ensuring the commons grows rather than being privatized.

## Versions

The GPL has evolved through major versions:

- **GPLv1 (1989)**: Initial version
- **GPLv2 (1991)**: Added patent provisions, still widely used
- **GPLv3 (2007)**: Addressed software patents and "tivoization"

## Impact

The GPL changed software development:

- Linux kernel uses GPLv2
- Many GNU tools use GPL
- Influenced other copyleft licenses
- Created legal framework for free software movement
- Sparked ongoing debates about software freedom vs. permissive licensing
