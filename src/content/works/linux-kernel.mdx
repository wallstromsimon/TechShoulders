The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system family. It is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel.

## Origins

Linus Torvalds began developing the Linux kernel in 1991 while a student at the University of Helsinki. He initially created it as a personal project inspired by MINIX, a small Unix-like operating system used for teaching.

## Impact

Linux has become the dominant operating system kernel in several domains:

- **Servers**: Powers the majority of web servers, including those running most of the internet
- **Supercomputers**: Runs on 100% of the top 500 supercomputers
- **Mobile**: Forms the foundation of Android, the world's most popular mobile OS
- **Embedded Systems**: Used in countless devices from routers to smart TVs
- **Cloud Computing**: The primary OS for cloud infrastructure providers

## Development Model

The Linux kernel pioneered the open-source development model at scale. Thousands of developers from companies worldwide contribute code, with Torvalds and trusted maintainers managing the integration of changes.

## Legacy

Linux demonstrated that a community-developed, freely available operating system could compete with and surpass proprietary alternatives. It fundamentally changed how the software industry thinks about open source.
