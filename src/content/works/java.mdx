Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for portability and enterprise reliability. Created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy transformed software development.

## Origins

Gosling began developing Java (originally called "Oak") in 1991 as part of Sun's Green Project, aimed at interactive television. When that market didn't materialize, the team pivoted to the emerging World Wide Web, where Java's portability was ideal.

## Key Innovations

Java introduced concepts that became industry standards:

- **Platform Independence**: Bytecode runs on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- **Managed Memory**: Automatic garbage collection
- **Strong Typing**: Catches errors at compile time
- **Security Model**: Sandboxed execution for untrusted code

## Enterprise Dominance

Java became the dominant enterprise language:

- **J2EE/Jakarta EE**: Enterprise application platforms
- **Spring Framework**: Dependency injection and enterprise patterns
- **Android**: Java (later Kotlin) powers billions of mobile devices
- **Big Data**: Hadoop, Spark built on the JVM

## The JVM Ecosystem

Java's lasting impact may be the JVM itself. Languages like Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, and Groovy run on the JVM, benefiting from its optimizations while offering different programming paradigms. The JVM's just-in-time compilation makes dynamic languages surprisingly fast.
