HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in web browsers. Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 as a core component of the World Wide Web, HTML provides the structure and content of web pages, enabling the hypertext linking that makes the Web navigable.

## Origins

When Tim Berners-Lee designed the World Wide Web at CERN, he needed a simple way to create documents that could link to each other. Drawing inspiration from SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), he created HTML—a streamlined markup language that anyone could learn<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

The first version of HTML was deliberately simple. Berners-Lee defined just 18 tags, including:

- `<a>` for hyperlinks (the revolutionary feature)
- `<h1>` through `<h6>` for headings
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<ul>` and `<ol>` for lists

This simplicity was intentional. Berners-Lee wanted scientists—not just programmers—to be able to create web pages.

## The Hyperlink Revolution

The `<a>` tag, which creates hyperlinks, was HTML's most important innovation. By clicking a link, users could instantly jump to another document anywhere on the Web. This simple mechanism transformed how humans navigate information<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

Before hyperlinks, finding related information meant manual searches through indexes, catalogs, or citations. Hyperlinks made knowledge exploration seamless and intuitive.

## Evolution

HTML has evolved significantly since 1990:

- **HTML 2.0 (1995)**: First formal specification as an IETF standard
- **HTML 4.01 (1999)**: Added frames, scripting support, and stylesheets
- **XHTML (2000)**: Reformulated HTML as XML for stricter syntax
- **HTML5 (2014)**: Major revision adding video, audio, canvas, and semantic elements

HTML5, developed by the WHATWG and W3C, brought native multimedia support, eliminating the need for plugins like Flash for common tasks<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>.

## Design Philosophy

HTML's success stems from several key principles:

- **Forgiveness**: Browsers render malformed HTML as best they can, rather than failing
- **Separation of concerns**: HTML handles structure; CSS handles presentation; JavaScript handles behavior
- **Accessibility**: Semantic elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies
- **Backward compatibility**: New features don't break old pages

## Impact

HTML democratized publishing. Before the Web, reaching a global audience required publishers, broadcasters, or significant capital. With HTML, anyone with a text editor could publish to the world.

Today, there are over 1.9 billion websites. Every one of them uses HTML.
