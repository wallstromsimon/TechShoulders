Clojure is a modern Lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Created by Rich Hickey, it emphasizes immutability and functional programming while providing practical access to Java's ecosystem.

## Origins

Rich Hickey spent two years developing Clojure before its 2007 release. He wanted a Lisp for the modern age—one that could leverage the JVM's performance and libraries while embracing functional programming principles.

## Key Features

Clojure introduced distinctive concepts:

- **Persistent data structures**: Immutable but efficient through structural sharing
- **Software transactional memory**: Safe concurrent updates
- **Protocols and multimethods**: Flexible polymorphism
- **Homoiconicity**: Code as data, enabling powerful macros
- **REPL-driven development**: Interactive programming workflow

## Design Philosophy

Hickey's philosophy shapes Clojure:

- **Simple vs. Easy**: Simplicity (few concepts) matters more than ease (familiarity)
- **Immutability by default**: Mutable state is opt-in
- **Data over objects**: Plain data structures over complex objects
- **Leverage the host**: Full interop with Java ecosystem

## Impact

Clojure proved that:

- Lisp could be practical for modern development
- Immutability could work in real applications
- Functional programming could run on the JVM
- Old ideas (1958's Lisp) could solve new problems (concurrency)
