Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code is a seminal 1999 book by Martin Fowler that codified the practice of restructuring code without changing its behavior. It transformed how developers think about improving code quality.

## Core Concept

Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in ways that:

- Do not alter external behavior
- Improve internal structure
- Make the code easier to understand
- Reduce the cost of future changes

## The Catalog

Fowler's book provides a catalog of refactoring techniques, each with:

- A descriptive name
- Motivation for when to use it
- Step-by-step mechanics
- Code examples before and after

## Classic Refactorings

Notable techniques from the book:

- **Extract Method**: Pull code into a named function
- **Rename Variable**: Make names communicate intent
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Use objects instead of if-else
- **Move Method**: Put behavior where the data lives

## Impact on Software Development

The book influenced:

- IDE refactoring tools (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)
- Test-driven development (refactor step in red-green-refactor)
- Agile practices emphasizing continuous improvement
- Code review culture focused on maintainability

## Legacy

Refactoring gave developers a shared vocabulary for code improvement and validated the practice as a professional discipline. The second edition (2018) updated examples to JavaScript for modern relevance.
