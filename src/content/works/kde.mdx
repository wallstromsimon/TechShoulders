KDE (originally K Desktop Environment) is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like systems. Founded by Matthias Ettrich in 1996, it brought a consistent, user-friendly graphical interface to Linux.

## Origins

Matthias Ettrich started KDE in 1996 because Linux lacked a consistent desktop environment. He chose Qt as the toolkit, which provided the foundation for professional-quality applications.

## Design Goals

KDE aimed to provide:

- **Consistency**: Unified look and applications
- **Usability**: Desktop environment for everyday users
- **Customization**: Highly configurable interface
- **Integration**: Applications that work well together

## Evolution

KDE has evolved through major versions:

- **KDE 1** (1998): First stable release
- **KDE 2** (2000): DCOP component communication
- **KDE 3** (2002): Matured platform
- **KDE 4** (2008): Complete rewrite with Plasma
- **KDE Plasma 5** (2014): Modern, resource-efficient

## Applications

KDE produced major applications:

- **Dolphin**: File manager
- **Konsole**: Terminal emulator
- **Kate**: Text editor
- **Kdenlive**: Video editor
- **Krita**: Digital painting
- **KMail**: Email client

## Legacy

KDE proved that open-source projects could create polished, user-friendly software. It made Linux viable for desktop users and influenced graphical interface design across platforms.
