Quake is a first-person shooter that pioneered true 3D graphics in games. John Carmack's engine technology enabled fully three-dimensional environments, revolutionizing game graphics and establishing 3D as the standard.

## Technical Breakthroughs

Carmack's Quake engine introduced:

- **True 3D rendering**: Polygonal environments, not tricks
- **Lightmaps**: Pre-computed lighting for realistic illumination
- **Client-server networking**: Enabling internet multiplayer
- **QuakeC**: Scripting language for game logic
- **OpenGL support**: Hardware acceleration via graphics cards

## Impact on Gaming

Quake transformed the industry:

- Established 3D graphics as the standard
- Created modern competitive gaming (QuakeCon)
- Enabled online multiplayer gaming
- Launched careers (machinima, modding)

## Engine Licensing

The Quake engine powered numerous games:

- Half-Life (modified Quake engine)
- Call of Duty series (evolved from Quake 3 engine)
- Countless licensed titles

## Open Source Legacy

id released Quake's source code under GPL, enabling:

- Source ports with modern features
- Learning resource for 3D graphics
- Foundation for derivative projects
