Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Created by Evan You, it combines ideas from Angular and React into an approachable, versatile framework that can scale from simple widgets to complex applications.

## Origins

Evan You created Vue after working on AngularJS projects at Google. He wanted to extract the parts of Angular he liked—data binding, declarative templates—into something lighter and more approachable.

## Key Features

Vue's design emphasizes approachability:

- **Reactive data binding**: Automatic UI updates when data changes
- **Single-file components**: Template, script, and styles together
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering like React
- **Directives**: Angular-like template syntax
- **Progressive adoption**: Use as much or as little as needed

## Ecosystem

Vue has a rich ecosystem:

- **Vue Router**: Official routing library
- **Vuex/Pinia**: State management
- **Nuxt.js**: Server-side rendering framework
- **Vite**: Modern build tool (also by Evan You)

## Impact

Vue proved that frameworks could be both powerful and approachable:

- Third most popular frontend framework
- Strong adoption in Asia, especially China
- Influenced React and Angular to simplify
- Demonstrated viable solo-developer framework development
