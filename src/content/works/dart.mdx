Dart is a programming language developed by Google for building web, mobile, and desktop applications. Created by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund, it found its niche as the language for Flutter, Google's cross-platform UI framework.

## Origins

Google developed Dart as a potential JavaScript replacement for web development. Though browsers never natively adopted Dart, the language found success in other contexts.

## Key Features

Dart combines familiar concepts:

- **Object-oriented**: Classes and inheritance
- **Strong typing**: Optional static types
- **Async/await**: First-class asynchronous support
- **Null safety**: Sound null handling
- **Hot reload**: Instant development feedback

## Flutter and Success

Dart's success came through Flutter:

- Cross-platform mobile development
- Single codebase for iOS and Android
- Growing web and desktop support
- Fast UI rendering through Dart's AOT compilation

## Design Philosophy

Dart prioritizes:

- Familiar syntax (Java/JavaScript-like)
- Fast development iteration
- Predictable performance
- Scalability for large applications
