COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a compiled programming language designed for business data processing. Created in 1959, it was one of the first high-level programming languages and pioneered the use of English-like syntax. Despite its age, COBOL remains in active use today, processing an estimated 95% of ATM transactions and 80% of in-person transactions globally.

## Origins

In 1959, the U.S. Department of Defense sponsored a conference to develop a common business programming language. The CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Languages) consortium brought together computer manufacturers, government agencies, and users<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

Grace Hopper's earlier work on FLOW-MATIC, one of the first English-like programming languages, heavily influenced COBOL's design. Her vision of programming in words rather than symbols became COBOL's defining characteristic.

## Design Philosophy

COBOL was revolutionary in its approach<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>:

- **English-like syntax**: Programs read almost like English prose, making them accessible to business managers
- **Self-documenting**: The verbose syntax serves as built-in documentation
- **Machine independence**: Programs could run on different manufacturers' computers
- **Business focus**: Built-in support for decimal arithmetic and record processing

A simple COBOL statement like `ADD HOURS-WORKED TO TOTAL-HOURS` was radically more readable than equivalent assembly code.

## Impact

COBOL transformed business computing:

- **Democratized programming**: Business analysts could understand and even write code
- **Standardization**: Multiple ANSI/ISO standards ensured portability
- **Longevity**: Programs written in the 1960s still run today

## Modern Relevance

Despite predictions of its demise, COBOL remains critical infrastructure<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>:

- 220 billion lines of COBOL code remain in active use
- Major banks, insurance companies, and government agencies depend on COBOL systems
- The COVID-19 pandemic exposed shortages of COBOL programmers when unemployment systems became overwhelmed

COBOL's longevity demonstrates both its robust design and the challenge of replacing mission-critical systems.
