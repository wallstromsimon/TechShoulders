CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Created by Jeremy Ashkenas, it added syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby and Python, making JavaScript development more pleasant before ES6 modernized the language.

## Origins

Ashkenas created CoffeeScript in 2009, frustrated by JavaScript's verbose syntax. CoffeeScript offered cleaner alternatives: arrow functions, classes, destructuring, and more.

## Key Features

CoffeeScript introduced conveniences:

- **Arrow functions**: `->` and `=>` for functions
- **Classes**: Clean class syntax
- **Destructuring**: Pattern-matching assignment
- **String interpolation**: Variables in strings
- **List comprehensions**: Declarative iteration
- **Significant whitespace**: Python-style indentation

## Peak Adoption

CoffeeScript was hugely popular from 2010-2015:

- Dropbox used it extensively
- Rails included CoffeeScript support
- Many developers preferred it to JavaScript

## Legacy

Ironically, CoffeeScript's success led to its decline. ES6 (2015) adopted many CoffeeScript features—arrow functions, classes, destructuring, template literals—making CoffeeScript less necessary. The language proved these features were wanted; JavaScript just needed to add them.
