SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and querying relational databases. Developed at IBM in the 1970s as part of the System R project, SQL became an industry standard and remains the dominant interface for database systems worldwide.

## Origins

Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory designed SQL (originally called SEQUEL—Structured English Query Language) to provide a practical interface to Edgar Codd's relational model. Their goal was a language that non-programmers could use to retrieve and manipulate data<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

The name was shortened to SQL due to trademark conflicts with an existing SEQUEL product.

## Revolutionary Approach

SQL introduced declarative programming to data management:

**Declarative, Not Procedural**: Users specify *what* data they want, not *how* to get it. `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000` describes the desired result; the database determines the optimal retrieval method.

**Set-Based Operations**: SQL operates on sets of rows rather than individual records, making bulk operations natural and efficient.

**English-Like Syntax**: Keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY were chosen to be readable by non-programmers.

## Core Operations

SQL encompasses several categories of commands:

- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: SELECT statements for retrieving data
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for modifying data
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: CREATE, ALTER, DROP for defining schema
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: GRANT, REVOKE for access control

## Standardization

SQL became an ANSI standard in 1986 and an ISO standard in 1987. Subsequent revisions added features:

- SQL-89: Minor revision
- SQL-92: Major expansion with new data types
- SQL:1999: Object-relational features, recursive queries
- SQL:2003: XML support, window functions
- SQL:2011: Temporal data
- SQL:2016: JSON support

## Ubiquity

Every major relational database implements SQL: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and dozens more. While each vendor adds proprietary extensions, core SQL remains remarkably consistent. Knowing SQL provides access to virtually any relational database system<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

Even non-relational systems increasingly support SQL or SQL-like interfaces, recognizing its value as a lingua franca for data.
