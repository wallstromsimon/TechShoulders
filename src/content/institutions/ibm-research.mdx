IBM Research is the research and development division of IBM, one of the world's largest and most influential technology research organizations. Founded in 1945, it has produced foundational advances in computing including the relational database model, RISC architecture, and numerous programming languages.

## Origins and Growth

IBM's research efforts began in 1945 when the company established its first pure research group at Columbia University. The Thomas J. Watson Research Center opened in Yorktown Heights, New York in 1961, becoming the flagship of what would grow into a global network of research laboratories<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

## Database Revolution

IBM Research's most transformative contribution to software may be the relational database. Edgar F. Codd, working at IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory, published "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" in 1970, establishing the theoretical foundation for modern databases.

The System R project (1973–1979) implemented Codd's ideas and created SQL, which became the industry standard for database queries. Every major database system today—Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server—traces its lineage to this work.

## Notable Contributions

IBM Research has produced numerous computing breakthroughs:

- **FORTRAN** (1957) — The first high-level programming language
- **DRAM** (1966) — Robert Dennard's invention powers computer memory
- **Relational databases** (1970) — Codd's model revolutionized data management
- **RISC architecture** (1974) — John Cocke's work influenced modern processors
- **Fractal geometry** (1975) — Benoit Mandelbrot's mathematical discoveries
- **Deep Blue** (1997) — First computer to defeat a world chess champion

## Nobel Prizes and Turing Awards

IBM Research has produced six Nobel Prize winners and five ACM Turing Award recipients, demonstrating its impact across computing and physics<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.
