The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit organization founded by Richard Stallman in 1985 to promote computer users' rights to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute software. It sponsors the GNU Project and maintains the GNU licenses.

## Mission

The FSF advocates for "free software" where "free" refers to freedom, not price:

- Users should control their computing
- Source code should be available
- Users should be able to share and modify software

## Key Activities

The FSF maintains and promotes:

- **GNU Project**: Free software development
- **GNU Licenses**: GPL, LGPL, AGPL, FDL
- **LibrePlanet**: Community conference
- **Campaigns**: Against DRM, proprietary software, surveillance

## Philosophy

The FSF distinguishes "free software" from "open source," emphasizing the ethical and political dimensions of software freedom over practical benefits. Stallman argues that proprietary software is a social problem that harms users and communities.

## Influence

The FSF's advocacy shaped software development:

- Created legal infrastructure for free software
- Inspired generations of developers
- Influenced policy debates about software and copyright
- Maintained ideological purity while open source became mainstream
