INRIA (Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique) is the French national research institute for computer science and automation. It has produced influential programming languages, formal verification tools, and foundational research.

## Key Contributions

INRIA has developed significant technologies:

- **OCaml**: Functional programming language
- **Coq**: Proof assistant for formal verification
- **CompCert**: Verified C compiler
- **Scilab**: Open-source numerical computation
- **Caml Light**: Early ML implementation

## Research Culture

INRIA emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Its researchers have made fundamental contributions to type theory, formal methods, and programming language semantics while building real tools.

## Collaboration

INRIA collaborates extensively with universities and industry. Its researchers often hold positions at French universities while conducting research at INRIA labs. International collaboration extends INRIA's influence globally.

## Influence

The programming language and formal methods communities owe much to INRIA:

- OCaml influenced Rust, F#, and Reason
- Coq is used worldwide for formal proofs
- CompCert demonstrated verified compilation
- INRIA researchers have trained generations of PL researchers
