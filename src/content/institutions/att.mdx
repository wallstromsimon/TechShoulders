AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph Company), founded in 1885 as a subsidiary of Bell Telephone Company, became the world's largest telecommunications company and one of the most important corporations in technology history. Through its Bell Labs research arm, AT&T produced foundational innovations including the transistor, Unix, C programming language, and information theory.

## Origins

Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876 and founded the Bell Telephone Company in 1877. In 1885, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was incorporated as a subsidiary to build and operate long-distance telephone networks<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

AT&T grew rapidly through the Bell System—a network of Bell-branded telephone companies across the United States. By 1899, AT&T had become the parent company of the entire Bell System, operating under the slogan "One Policy, One System, Universal Service."

## Monopoly Era (1913-1984)

In 1913, to avoid antitrust action, AT&T agreed to the Kingsbury Commitment: connecting independent telephone companies to the Bell network. In exchange, AT&T operated as a regulated monopoly for most of the 20th century.

This monopoly status provided stable revenue that funded extraordinary research:

### Bell Labs

Bell Telephone Laboratories, established in 1925, became one of the most productive research institutions in history<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>:

- **The Transistor** (1947): William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain invented the transistor, replacing vacuum tubes and enabling modern electronics
- **Information Theory** (1948): Claude Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" founded the mathematical study of information
- **Unix** (1969): Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created Unix, influencing virtually all modern operating systems
- **C Language** (1972): Dennis Ritchie developed C, one of the most influential programming languages
- **C++** (1979): Bjarne Stroustrup began developing C++

Bell Labs researchers won nine Nobel Prizes in Physics.

## Breaking the Monopoly

By the 1970s, regulators and competitors challenged AT&T's monopoly. In 1982, AT&T settled an antitrust suit by agreeing to divest its local telephone operations.

On January 1, 1984, the Bell System was broken up:

- AT&T retained long-distance service, Bell Labs, and Western Electric manufacturing
- Seven Regional Bell Operating Companies ("Baby Bells") took over local service

## Post-Breakup Evolution

After divestiture, AT&T went through multiple transformations<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>:

- **1995**: Split off Lucent Technologies (containing Bell Labs)
- **1996**: Acquired NCR Corporation
- **2000s**: Struggled against competition from cable and wireless companies
- **2005**: Acquired by SBC Communications (a Baby Bell), which took the AT&T name
- **2006**: Acquired BellSouth, reuniting much of the original Bell System
- **2018-2022**: Acquired and divested WarnerMedia

## Technical Legacy

AT&T's technical contributions extend far beyond specific inventions:

### Standards Development

AT&T shaped telecommunications standards that enabled global connectivity, from telephone signaling protocols to data communications standards.

### The Bell System Technical Journal

Published research that advanced telecommunications science worldwide.

### Training and Education

Bell System training programs educated generations of telecommunications engineers.

## Modern AT&T

Today's AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the United States, providing:

- Wireless services (AT&T Mobility)
- Internet access (fiber and DSL)
- Business communications services

Though the monopoly is long gone and Bell Labs is now part of Nokia, AT&T remains a major force in telecommunications—a direct descendant of the company Alexander Graham Bell founded to commercialize his telephone.
