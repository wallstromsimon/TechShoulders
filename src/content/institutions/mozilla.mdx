Mozilla is a free software community and non-profit organization best known for the Firefox web browser. Emerging from Netscape's open-sourcing of Navigator, Mozilla has championed open web standards and user privacy.

## Origins

When Netscape released Navigator's source code in 1998, the Mozilla project was born. After years of development, Firefox launched in 2004 and quickly gained significant market share.

## Key Contributions

Mozilla has produced significant technologies:

- **Firefox**: Privacy-focused web browser
- **Rust**: Memory-safe systems programming language
- **Servo**: Experimental browser engine
- **WebAssembly**: Browser-based binary format (co-developed)
- **MDN Web Docs**: Essential web development documentation

## Mission

Mozilla's mission centers on internet health:

- Open web standards
- User privacy
- Decentralized power
- Web literacy

## Challenges

Mozilla has faced market share challenges:

- Chrome's dominance reduced Firefox share
- Revenue depends heavily on search deals
- Layoffs reduced Rust and Servo teams

Despite challenges, Mozilla continues advocating for user-centric web development.
