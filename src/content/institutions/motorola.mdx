Motorola, founded in 1928, was an American electronics company that pioneered mobile communications, from car radios in the 1930s to the first handheld cellular phone in 1973. The company's innovations shaped the development of wireless technology, semiconductors, and mobile computing before being split into separate companies in 2011.

## Founding

Paul Galvin and his brother Joseph founded the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in Chicago in 1928. Their first product was a battery eliminator, allowing battery-powered radios to run on household electricity.

In 1930, the company introduced the first commercially successful car radio. They marketed it as "Motorola"—combining "motor" (for motorcar) and "ola" (suggesting sound)—and the name proved so popular that the company was renamed Motorola, Inc. in 1947<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

## Wartime and Mobile Radio

During World War II, Motorola produced the SCR-300, the first backpack FM radio ("walkie-talkie"), and the SCR-536 handie-talkie. These portable radios transformed military communications and established Motorola as a leader in mobile radio technology.

After the war, Motorola applied this expertise to civilian products:

- Police and emergency radio systems
- Pagers (popularized the "beeper")
- Two-way radios for businesses

## The Cellular Revolution

Motorola's most significant contribution was the development of handheld cellular technology<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>:

### DynaTAC Development

In the early 1970s, Martin Cooper led a team that developed the DynaTAC (Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage). On April 3, 1973, Cooper made the first public handheld cellular phone call—to a rival at AT&T Bell Labs.

### Commercial Launch

After a decade of development and regulatory approval, Motorola introduced the DynaTAC 8000x in 1983—the first commercially available handheld cellular phone.

### Mobile Innovation

Motorola continued leading mobile phone innovation:

- **MicroTAC** (1989): First flip phone
- **StarTAC** (1996): First clamshell phone, hugely popular
- **RAZR** (2004): Iconic thin flip phone, sold over 130 million units

## Semiconductor Legacy

Motorola was also a major semiconductor manufacturer. The Motorola 68000 processor family powered:

- Apple Macintosh computers (1984-1994)
- Amiga computers
- Atari ST computers
- Sega Genesis gaming consoles

The semiconductor division was spun off as Freescale Semiconductor in 2004 (later acquired by NXP).

## Corporate Evolution

Motorola split into two companies in 2011<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>:

### Motorola Mobility

Focuses on smartphones and consumer devices. Acquired by Google in 2012, then sold to Lenovo in 2014. Continues producing Motorola-branded smartphones.

### Motorola Solutions

Focuses on enterprise communications: police and emergency radios, public safety networks, and business communication systems.

## Technical Contributions

Beyond products, Motorola contributed to telecommunications standards and technology:

- Six Sigma quality methodology (popularized by Motorola)
- Iridium satellite system (founded by Motorola)
- Cellular technology standards development
- Numerous patents in wireless communication

## Legacy

Motorola's vision—that wireless communication should be personal and portable—drove the mobile revolution. From the first car radio to the first handheld cell phone to iconic devices like the RAZR, Motorola innovations shaped how billions of people communicate.

The company's influence extends beyond products: its engineers developed fundamental technologies, its standards work enabled interoperability, and its competitive drive—particularly against AT&T—pushed the industry toward personal mobile devices rather than car-bound phones.
