The Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) is an independent research center founded in 1930 in Princeton, New Jersey. It has been home to some of the most brilliant minds in science and mathematics, including Albert Einstein and John von Neumann.

## Founding

The Institute was founded by educator Abraham Flexner with funding from Louis Bamberger and his sister Caroline Bamberger Fuld. Unlike a university, the IAS has no students in the traditional sense—only faculty and visiting scholars pursuing fundamental research without teaching obligations.

## Computing Contributions

The IAS played a crucial role in the development of modern computing:

**The IAS Machine** (1945-1951): Under John von Neumann's direction, the Institute built one of the first stored-program computers. The IAS machine used binary arithmetic and shared memory for code and data—the architecture now known as the von Neumann architecture<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

The IAS machine design was freely shared and influenced numerous subsequent computers, including the MANIAC at Los Alamos, the ILLIAC at the University of Illinois, and the JOHNNIAC at RAND Corporation.

## Notable Faculty

The Institute's School of Mathematics has included:

- **Albert Einstein** (1933-1955)
- **John von Neumann** (1933-1957)
- **Kurt Gödel** (1940-1978)
- **Hermann Weyl** (1933-1951)

## Legacy

The IAS continues as a leading center for theoretical research. Its model of providing scholars with complete freedom to pursue fundamental questions has influenced research institutions worldwide.
