NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the U.S. government agency responsible for space exploration and aeronautics research. Its demanding computational requirements drove advances in software engineering and computing.

## Computing Contributions

NASA's missions required computing advances:

- Early guidance computers for Mercury, Gemini, Apollo
- Software engineering methodologies
- Real-time systems development
- Fault-tolerant computing

## Key Programs

NASA programs pushed computing boundaries:

- **Apollo**: Margaret Hamilton's software engineering
- **Space Shuttle**: Complex flight software systems
- **Mars rovers**: Autonomous navigation software
- **James Webb**: Advanced image processing

## Human Computers

Before electronic computers, NASA (and its predecessor NACA) employed human "computers"—mathematicians who performed calculations by hand. Katherine Johnson and others calculated trajectories for early space missions.

## Open Source and Data

NASA now contributes to open source and shares vast datasets:

- Open source software catalog
- Earth observation data
- Scientific datasets
- Technology transfer programs
