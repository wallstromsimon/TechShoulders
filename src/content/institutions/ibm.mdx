International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), known as "Big Blue," is one of the oldest and most influential technology companies. For decades, IBM dominated the computer industry, and its research labs produced many foundational innovations in computing.

## Computing History

IBM's role in computing history spans from mechanical tabulating machines to modern cloud computing:

**Mainframe Era**: In the 1950s and 1960s, IBM dominated the computer market with its mainframe systems. The IBM 704 (1954) and System/360 (1964) defined enterprise computing<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

**FORTRAN**: In 1957, John Backus and his IBM team created FORTRAN, the first widely-used high-level programming language. This proved that computers could efficiently compile human-readable code.

**Hard Drives**: IBM invented the hard disk drive with the IBM 350 (1956), revolutionizing data storage.

**Personal Computing**: The IBM PC (1981) established the architecture that dominates personal computing to this day, though IBM eventually lost control of the market it created.

## IBM Research

IBM Research, founded in 1945, is one of the world's largest and most influential industrial research organizations:

- **Turing Award Winners**: Multiple IBM researchers have won computing's highest honor
- **Nobel Prizes**: IBM researchers have won Nobel Prizes in physics for discoveries including the scanning tunneling microscope
- **Patent Leadership**: IBM has led in U.S. patent grants for decades

## Legacy

IBM's influence extends beyond any single product. The company's emphasis on research, standardization, and enterprise computing shaped the modern technology industry.
