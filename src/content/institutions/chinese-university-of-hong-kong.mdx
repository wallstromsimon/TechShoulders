The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), founded in 1963, is a leading research university in Hong Kong known for its contributions to science and technology. Charles K. Kao, the Nobel Prize-winning "Father of Fiber Optics," served as Vice-Chancellor from 1987 to 1996 and helped establish the university's electronics department.

## History

CUHK was founded in 1963 through the federation of three existing colleges: New Asia College (founded 1949), Chung Chi College (1951), and United College (1956). It was the second university established in Hong Kong after the University of Hong Kong<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

The university was founded with a mission to promote Chinese culture and provide bilingual education (Chinese and English), bridging Eastern and Western academic traditions.

## Academic Structure

CUHK pioneered the collegiate system in Hong Kong. Today it comprises nine colleges, each with its own identity and traditions, providing students with both the resources of a large research university and the community of smaller residential colleges.

## Research Excellence

CUHK has developed strong research programs across many fields:

### Technology and Engineering

- Fiber optics and telecommunications (pioneered by Charles Kao)
- Computer science and artificial intelligence
- Biomedical engineering

### Medicine and Life Sciences

- The Faculty of Medicine is among Asia's most prestigious
- Strong programs in traditional Chinese medicine research

### Business and Economics

- CUHK Business School ranks among Asia's top business schools

## Charles K. Kao's Legacy

Charles Kao joined CUHK in 1970, establishing the Department of Electronics and later becoming the first Dean of Engineering. His work building the university's technical programs helped establish Hong Kong as a technology hub<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

As Vice-Chancellor (1987-1996), Kao expanded the university significantly, increasing enrollment and research funding. After receiving the Nobel Prize in 2009, he and his wife founded the Charles K. Kao Foundation for Alzheimer's Disease in Hong Kong.

## Modern Role

With over 20,000 students and significant research output, CUHK is consistently ranked among Asia's top universities. Its strategic location in Hong Kong positions it as a bridge between Chinese academic traditions and international research communities<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>.
