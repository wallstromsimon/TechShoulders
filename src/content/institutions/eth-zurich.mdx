ETH Zurich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich) is a public research university in Zurich, Switzerland. One of the world's leading technical universities, ETH Zurich has been home to numerous computing pioneers and groundbreaking research in programming languages and systems.

## Computing History

ETH Zurich's computer science department has produced influential work across the field:

**Programming Languages**: Niklaus Wirth spent most of his career at ETH Zurich, designing Pascal, Modula-2, and Oberon. His emphasis on simplicity, structure, and educational clarity influenced a generation of language designers<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>.

**The Lilith Workstation**: In the late 1970s, Wirth's group built the Lilith personal workstation entirely in Modula-2, demonstrating that systems could be built in high-level languages.

**Project Oberon**: The complete Oberon operating system and compiler, developed at ETH Zurich, showed how an entire computing system could be made simple and transparent.

## Notable Figures

ETH Zurich has educated and employed many computing pioneers:

- **Niklaus Wirth**: Designer of Pascal, Modula-2, and Oberon; Turing Award winner
- **Albert Einstein**: Studied and later taught at ETH Zurich (physics, not computing, but notable)
- **Numerous Turing Award winners**: Including several in computing-related fields

## Research Excellence

The university consistently ranks among the top in the world for computer science research, with particular strengths in:

- Programming languages and compilers
- Systems and architecture
- Formal methods and verification
- Computer graphics
