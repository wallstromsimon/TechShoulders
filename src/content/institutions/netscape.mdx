Netscape Communications was an American technology company that created the Netscape Navigator web browser and pioneered commercial internet software. Founded in 1994 by Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen, Netscape brought the World Wide Web to mainstream users.

## Netscape Navigator

Netscape Navigator was the dominant web browser in the mid-1990s, holding over 90% market share at its peak. It introduced innovations like:

- Cookies for maintaining state
- JavaScript for client-side scripting
- SSL for secure connections
- Frames for page layouts

## The Browser Wars

Netscape's dominance was challenged by Microsoft's Internet Explorer, bundled with Windows. The resulting "browser wars" led to rapid innovation but also incompatible implementations. Netscape's market share declined precipitously.

## Mozilla and Open Source

In 1998, Netscape released Navigator's source code as the Mozilla project. This open-source effort eventually produced Firefox. The decision to open-source the browser influenced how companies approach open-source strategy.

## Legacy

Though Netscape as a company faded, its impact endures:

- JavaScript powers all web interactivity
- SSL evolved into TLS for secure communications
- Mozilla and Firefox continue
- Marc Andreessen became an influential venture capitalist
