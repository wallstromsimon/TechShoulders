Intel Corporation is an American semiconductor company that invented the microprocessor and dominated the PC processor market for decades. Founded by former Fairchild engineers, it became one of the world's most valuable technology companies.

## Founding

Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore founded Intel (Integrated Electronics) in 1968 after leaving Fairchild Semiconductor. Andy Grove, another Fairchild veteran, joined as employee number three and later became CEO.

## Key Innovations

Intel pioneered foundational technologies:

- **4004 (1971)**: First commercial microprocessor
- **8086 (1978)**: Foundation of the x86 architecture
- **386 (1985)**: First 32-bit x86 processor
- **Pentium (1993)**: Consumer brand recognition
- **Core architecture (2006)**: Modern multi-core design

## x86 Dominance

Intel's x86 architecture became the standard for personal computers. Through the IBM PC's adoption and successor designs, x86 processors powered most desktop and server computing for decades.

## Moore's Law

Gordon Moore's observation that transistor density doubles roughly every two years guided the industry. Intel's manufacturing prowess in delivering on this prediction defined semiconductor industry roadmaps.

## Recent Challenges

Intel has faced increased competition from AMD and ARM-based processors. The company's manufacturing lead diminished, and Apple's M-series chips showed that alternative architectures could match Intel's performance.
