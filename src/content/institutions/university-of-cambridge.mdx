The University of Cambridge is one of the world's oldest and most prestigious universities, founded in 1209. It has been central to the development of computing and mathematics, producing pioneers from Charles Babbage to Alan Turing and continuing as a leading center for computer science research.

## Computing Heritage

Cambridge's contributions to computing span two centuries:

**19th Century:**

- Charles Babbage studied at Trinity College (1810-1814)
- Babbage became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (1828-1839)
- The Analytical Society, which promoted modern mathematics, was founded here

**20th Century:**

- Alan Turing studied at King's College (1931-1934) and returned as a fellow
- The Mathematical Laboratory (later Computer Laboratory) was founded in 1937
- EDSAC, one of the first practical stored-program computers, ran here in 1949<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>

## The Computer Laboratory

Cambridge's Computer Laboratory has been influential in:

- Operating systems (including early work that influenced Unix)
- Programming languages (ML, Standard ML)
- Computer architecture (ARM processors originated from Acorn, a Cambridge spinoff)
- Networking (foundational internet research)

## Notable Alumni in Computing

The university has educated numerous computing pioneers:

- Charles Babbage (mechanical computation)
- Alan Turing (theoretical computer science, AI)
- Maurice Wilkes (EDSAC, microprogramming)
- Robin Milner (programming language theory)
- Tim Berners-Lee (affiliated, World Wide Web)
