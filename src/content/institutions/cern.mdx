CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (from the French "Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire"), is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Founded in 1954, CERN operates the Large Hadron Collider and has made fundamental contributions to both physics and computing—most notably as the birthplace of the World Wide Web.

## Origins

CERN was established in 1954 by twelve European nations seeking to rebuild European science after World War II and provide peaceful applications for nuclear physics<sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>. Located on the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, CERN has grown to include 23 member states and thousands of scientists from around the world.

## The Birthplace of the Web

CERN's most profound contribution to computing came from an unlikely source: a proposal to solve information management problems.

In 1989, British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee submitted a paper titled "Information Management: A Proposal" to address the challenge of sharing information among CERN's geographically dispersed researchers. His supervisor's response—"vague, but exciting"—became one of history's great understatements<sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>.

By December 1990, Berners-Lee had created all the components of the World Wide Web:

- The first web browser and editor (WorldWideWeb)
- The first web server
- HTML, HTTP, and URLs

The first website, info.cern.ch, went live at CERN on December 20, 1990.

## Making the Web Free

In April 1993, CERN made a decision that changed history: releasing the Web's technology into the public domain, royalty-free<sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>. This ensured that the Web would remain open and accessible, enabling the explosive growth that followed.

## Computing Contributions

Beyond the Web, CERN has contributed significantly to computing:

- **ROOT**: A data analysis framework used throughout high-energy physics
- **GEANT**: Particle physics simulation software
- **Grid computing**: Pioneered distributed computing for processing Large Hadron Collider data
- **Open Source**: Strong tradition of releasing software as open source

## Legacy

CERN demonstrates how fundamental research can yield unexpected practical benefits. A laboratory built to study particle physics produced the technology that transformed human communication and commerce. Today, over 5 billion people use the Web—a tool created to help physicists share their data.
