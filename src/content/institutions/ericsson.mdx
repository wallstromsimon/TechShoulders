Ericsson is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company and one of the world's oldest technology companies. Its internal research lab created Erlang, a programming language that revolutionized how distributed, fault-tolerant systems are built.

## Erlang Development

Ericsson's Computer Science Laboratory developed Erlang in the 1980s to handle telephone switching systems. The language's requirements—extreme reliability, concurrent processing, and zero-downtime updates—came directly from telecom needs.

## Open Source Release

In 1998, Ericsson open-sourced Erlang after initially trying to restrict its use internally. This decision allowed Erlang to spread beyond telecommunications and influence the broader software industry.

## Infrastructure Impact

Ericsson's work on Erlang and the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) established patterns for building reliable distributed systems that influenced:

- Modern messaging systems (WhatsApp, Discord)
- Database systems (CouchDB, Riak)
- Cloud infrastructure design patterns
- The Elixir programming language

## Continued Development

Ericsson continues to support Erlang development and uses it in its telecommunications infrastructure, maintaining one of the largest Erlang codebases in the world.
